[11/3/2011 10:02:02 AM] shawnleecl: terrible at reading satellite images, can't make anything out
[11/3/2011 10:02:50 AM] cloneshouse: Have you ever tried before...You could do better this time around because we have some high res images
[11/3/2011 10:03:22 AM] shawnleecl: haven't tried it before, tried the Australian test or something online
[11/3/2011 10:03:33 AM] shawnleecl: think it went out in an email

[11/8/2011 12:50:35 PM] cloneshouse: Hello I think that map is a privately watched map
[11/8/2011 12:56:16 PM] lujeke: the liberia run-off electionis on-going
[11/8/2011 12:56:39 PM] lujeke: check out liberia2011.ushahidi.com to get the latest updates
[11/8/2011 12:58:24 PM] heatherleson: Luther - your Ushahidi Liberia team is doing a fantastic job!
[11/8/2011 1:04:07 PM] lujeke: Thanks Heather
[11/8/2011 1:04:26 PM] lujeke: we appreciate all your support too
[11/8/2011 10:22:00 PM] shadrock.roberts: Not sure what to do about this, but I've got some fairly credible information that there could be serious violence surrounding the upcoming elections in DRC on Nov. 27th. Just wanted to put it on the radar...
[11/9/2011 10:16:43 AM] Melissa Elliott: there's a Ushahidi instance being setup for that...
[11/9/2011 10:19:28 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: by who?
[11/9/2011 10:24:06 AM] Melissa Elliott: I'm looking for it...it's a Prof from Penn State (I think)
[11/9/2011 10:28:38 AM] josephrichardpollack: please do post it when you find out (rock)
[11/9/2011 10:36:23 AM] Melissa Elliott: Here it is. This came to me from someone within the SBTF who has a connection with the Prof running the instance (for the life of me, can't remember the SBTF'er - totally embarrasing - blaming it on sleep deprivation - SORRY!! )     Here's the link to the Prof: http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/people/ruffer.html    and here's a link to the Ushahidi instance:  http://46.137.77.92/.   They MAY reach out for assistance - probably wouldn't be a SBTF deployment, but a "if you're interested" type of thing.
[11/9/2011 10:38:32 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: any idea if they are linking to people on the ground?
[11/9/2011 10:38:48 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: might be worth sharing some of the lessons we learned on sudan vote monitor...
[11/9/2011 10:39:38 AM] Melissa Elliott: I'm sorry - i don't. Racking my feeble brain to think of the most awesome sbtf'er that sent me this....gah
[11/9/2011 10:40:08 AM] Melissa Elliott: hey - duh.  It was Bharathi!
[11/9/2011 10:40:47 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: ahaaaa. will drop her a line.
[11/9/2011 10:40:48 AM] Melissa Elliott: I'll pop a note
[11/9/2011 10:41:02 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: oh snap - you go for it :) copy me?
[11/9/2011 10:41:02 AM] Melissa Elliott: actually - if you could just let me do it so I can explain the share
[11/9/2011 10:41:08 AM] Melissa Elliott: :)
[11/9/2011 10:43:43 AM] likeaword: Hi everyone. I'm quite new around here but I thought you might be interested. I gave a talk at a conference for UK emergency managers yesterday. I was talking about digital skills in community resilience. Their knowledge of this area was quite low: out of a room of 40 people only 3 had heard of Ushahidi for example. I talked a little bit about some of the things SBTF has been involved with. I think it's fair to say it blew them away. :)
[11/9/2011 10:46:37 AM] bharathi.ram23: hey Melissa and Helena!
[11/9/2011 10:46:59 AM] bharathi.ram23: I actually don't know too much about it. Patrick is the best person to ask, he's been coordinating with Galya Ruffer of Northwestern about it.
[11/9/2011 10:47:08 AM] josephrichardpollack: speak of the devil! (thank you for the tip about DRC map!)
[11/9/2011 10:47:12 AM] bharathi.ram23: I've only been trying to build a very small MM team for the effort and I really don't know much. Best you ask Patrick:)
[11/9/2011 10:47:17 AM] bharathi.ram23: haha..
[11/9/2011 10:47:48 AM] josephrichardpollack: would love to join the MM team (was on it for somalia - but speak no arabic) PM me if you would like me to join!
[11/9/2011 10:47:52 AM] Melissa Elliott: ha! thanks Bhar
[11/9/2011 10:47:59 AM] josephrichardpollack: somalia = Libya
[11/9/2011 10:48:56 AM] Melissa Elliott: bhar - can you just respond with that info to the email?  Helena is mtg with Patrick at ICCM and they can discuss there.
[11/9/2011 10:49:05 AM] bharathi.ram23: sure, thank you Joseph!
[11/9/2011 10:49:31 AM] bharathi.ram23: which email?
[11/9/2011 10:49:47 AM] josephrichardpollack: asking Melissa or me?

[11/9/2011 11:41:10 AM] Melissa Elliott: totally. loved that
[11/9/2011 12:06:30 PM] heatherleson: Hey Melissa, it is NorthWestern University and a few others working on the DRC
[11/9/2011 12:07:04 PM] heatherleson: If someone form the SBTF applies, keep us posted. BTW, I met Robbie in person in Ldn. So cool.
[11/9/2011 12:08:50 PM] Helena Puig Larrauri: shame that understanding africa is not a country isn't enough to qualify... pass the add on to some more techie friends!
[11/9/2011 12:14:19 PM] Melissa Elliott: yeah - thx. I posted the link to the Prof's bio above - thought it was Penn, but nooooo
[11/9/2011 6:04:41 PM] shadrock.roberts: @Helena: I talked to somebody in the USAID Mission who was really interested in this but, after briefing them on the groundwork required (based on what we saw with SVM) they realized that they just weren't going to have enough capacity to really do it. They were going to touch base with MONUSCO and look around. I never heard anything back but could try to follow up...
[11/9/2011 8:08:01 PM | Edited 8:08:42 PM] HR Catherine Graham: Hi Ben Proctor!  I'm just getting caught up in the window.  I'm glad to hear of your talk.  Wish I could have seen your talk on the digital  skills in support community resilience.  Glad to hear you spreading the word on what can be accomplished at the ground level!
[11/10/2011 1:23:31 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: @shadrock, glad you shared the svm experience. yeah, it's too late to set something up in my opinion... MONUSCO actually have a private early response system in the kivus that could be used to map reports, but i doubt they'd want their info public. and i'm just not sure publicly mapping violence in the DRC is a good idea in general. anyway, just interested, thanks for sharing.

    The location name field is required."
[11/10/2011 3:26:56 PM] Sara Farmer: Any clues?  It's what I'm getting when I put in a report on the ICCM SBTF site.
[11/10/2011 3:30:43 PM] Sara Farmer: Sorted - it wanted some text in the "refine location name" box.

[11/10/2011 5:35:25 PM] Sara Farmer: How's RHOK Oxford going?  I've seen some good messages going around the Open Data community about it.
[11/10/2011 6:04:31 PM] HR Jus Mackinnon: Evening Danny! I am happy to help in anyway I can. Now I work for myself I have some time.
[11/11/2011 1:57:53 AM] willidh: er
[11/11/2011 2:14:48 AM] willidh: RHOK Oxford is getting there - main thing we still need is more sponsorship for food & drink. People appear to be enrolling, which is good.
Jus, by all means come along for the weekend - I'm sure there's loads you can help do. Details are here: http://www.rhok.org/event/oxford-united-kingdom
[11/11/2011 8:33:54 AM] Sara Farmer: Erm. Apologies Danny, but I think I might have stolen Jus for RHOK NYC.
[11/11/2011 9:03:02 AM] willidh: thief !"

[11/11/2011 9:10:51 AM] willidh: Do we get anything in return?
[11/11/2011 9:11:30 AM] Sara Farmer: Dunno.  Are there any New Yorkers in this chat who fancy a long weekend in Oxford?  It's very nice - has architecture older than your country and everything...
[11/11/2011 9:18:31 AM] willidh: That would be fun
[11/11/2011 9:18:41 AM] willidh: any suggestions on how to  get funding for catering?

[11/11/2011 10:25:51 AM] willidh: ha ha
[11/11/2011 10:26:01 AM] willidh: use Xmas shopping as a pretext?
[11/11/2011 10:39:33 AM] Melissa Elliott: (*)  (*) ICCM Reports are coming in !   They're EXCELLENT so far!!  If you've submitted, but don't see yours live yet, we're holding off on the majority of the approvals until Sunday PM, early Monday AM so that the Geneva audience can see the map evolving as we go.  Please continue to sumbit reports!  We have 684 SBTF members, so we definitely hope to see hundreds of reports coming in.  THANKS!   (*)  (*)
[11/11/2011 10:52:15 AM] Sara Farmer: Danny - funding for catering. Try talking to to the BarCamp guys about this - Spike knows people like Leeky and Cristiano, who are very experienced at this now.  See http://nine.barcamplondon.org/about for contact details.
[11/11/2011 10:53:31 AM] Sara Farmer: You could also get creative - if this RHOK's theme is water, could you approach some of the bigger water companies for potential sponsorship or contacts?
[11/11/2011 10:54:35 AM] willidh: Oxfam are trying some of their corporate sponsors (like M&S) - not sure how much luck they are having. We have a call in 5 minutes so I might hear some good news

[11/12/2011 8:43:56 AM] Steven Longmire: Hello SBTF, I would greatly appreciate if any of the members could assist me on the Ushahidi maps API in creating hooks to allow me to update the status of requests for assistance so I can tie it into an already proven in multiple disasters mobile workforce management tool that has been provided by the creator at no cost for disasters. I had asked an individual, many months ago that identified it did not exist, but he would try to create it. Unfortunately, this individual for some reason was not able to assist, even though without question he was able.
[11/12/2011 8:45:41 AM] Steven Longmire: It was amazing to see the results at the camp last week, however it was interesting to see that someone had created those hooks, and without question, it is going to help accelerate getting help to people in the field. I just hope, that that company follows with deployment worldwide for disasters with the Ushahidi model of zero cost for that purpose.
[11/12/2011 8:47:14 AM] Steven Longmire: Is there anyone out there that can assist? Thank you very much, and I applaud the incredible, work that the SBTF, has and is continuing to do for assisting in the prevention of loss of life and property and disaster response. Some of the stuff you are doing is miraculous!  (y) (clap)
[11/12/2011 12:33:34 PM] Melissa Elliott: Not seeing a lot of new reports for the ICCM map.  PLEASE ensure you post a couple reports. We hope to see a couple hundred by the time the map goes live during the conference.
[11/12/2011 1:26:48 PM] Patrick Meier: Hey @Melissa, perhaps @Helena could send out another reminder via Ning?
[11/12/2011 5:30:29 PM] HR Catherine Graham: Perhaps you can make a selection bucket that doesnt disclose the participants physical location.  It may improve some of the responses.
[11/13/2011 3:43:46 AM] Steven Longmire: FTI, I was reviewing some of the notes on the external hooks and I found some mails whrere the person had stated they were not sure if they could get to it.  So sorry for saying they said they would create the hook, I found an email I had not been read that stated they would not have it on schedule.  Sorry for that, Does anyone have any time to guide me the correct path to make the hooks?  Thanks

[11/14/2011 9:14:33 AM] HR Jus Mackinnon: Can I do 2? lol
[11/14/2011 9:14:46 AM] rodrigodavies: do the reports need to be a little more serious / sbtf-related than just 'hello and here's what i'm doing'?
[11/14/2011 9:14:49 AM] Melissa Elliott: you can do 200
[11/14/2011 9:14:50 AM] Sara Farmer: Go on Jus - I already have!

[11/14/2011 9:14:56 AM] viequesbound: (*)
[11/14/2011 9:15:01 AM] Melissa Elliott: the purpose is to intro the audience to who we are. can be either serious or fun
[11/14/2011 9:15:01 AM] Sara Farmer: @Rodrigo - I've "what I'm doing now" with thoughts about crisismapping added to it.
[11/14/2011 9:15:41 AM] rodrigodavies: ok cool
[11/14/2011 9:16:01 AM] Sara Farmer: F'instance, I talked about picking up tree branches yesterday from our last snowstorm, and how that's tiny compared to rebuilding homes after a disaster.
[11/14/2011 9:16:27 AM] Sara Farmer: I think "why I'm a member of the SBTF" was also a suggestion...
[11/14/2011 9:17:41 AM] Sara Farmer: Go have a look at some of the existing reports to get ideas perhaps?
[11/14/2011 9:19:42 AM] Melissa Elliott: Rodrigo - saw it, approved it. Perfect! (sorry about your head :)
[11/14/2011 9:23:31 AM] Melissa Elliott: anyone in the room in Geneva that can tell me if the map is still onscreen?

[12/8/2011 9:59:42 AM] Steven Longmire: Thank you Sara, I already created a group, and will "Feed" the machine" LOL as time allows, I already see where this can go for common good, but I also know the money mongers are going to rtry to stem this in the wild.  The potential ties to AI integrations on the back end are amazing and "Simple".  I imiediately see a need for context binding on the NLP side, do we have contacts within the groups to University geeks working on NLP and language context mapping?  I would like to do an EMConnection show just on this topic, brought down to "plain english" so we can combine the PHD's with the non-PHD's (like me) that function with common sense, this could be an amazing accelerator in multiple venue's.  Thanks you again Sara!!!!

[12/9/2011 12:03:59 PM] viequesbound: Hi Mapsters!

I have splendid news: the SBTF was recognized for our Libya Crisis Map deployment for this year's International Online Volunteer Award!!

http://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/vol/stories/2011_ocha.html

Be sure to watch the video posted in that link.

Hugest congratulations to every SBTF mapster who was involved in this important deployment with our colleagues at UN OCHA. And a big thanks to our UN colleagues for having reached out to catalyze this partnership. We all have every reason to feel proud of ourselves. While improving our workflows and activation procedures is something that we must and will certainly continue to do, the Libya Crisis Map was launched just three short months after the SBTF itself was created. Way to start out strong, everyone!!

Many many thanks for all your hard work!!

Onwards!
Patrick & Team
[12/9/2011 2:35:23 PM] Steven Longmire: (clap) Kudo's to you incredible people!!!  (clap)

[12/9/2011 2:40:49 PM] Steven Longmire: If there are no deployments, and you have time, I am launching a game to trap any buggs before a big roll out of the "Free" version of GeoOp for Disaster response to North Amercia. (it ties into some announcements from some Cities in the US).  The Game has 2 parts.
[12/9/2011 2:42:39 PM] Steven Longmire: 1.2 for "Managers" / "Dispatchers", you must have an iPhone or Android phone (so you see both sides of the fence).  To play that role, send me your request to steven@emconnection.org and I'll bounce back the inctructions :)
[12/9/2011 2:48:24 PM | Edited 2:49:09 PM] Steven Longmire: To be a play victim, all you need is a Twitter account, and in your "play" requests for help, include the Hash Tag #GeoOpUSTest   That's it.  I'll capture the streams and post them to all participants once I figure out the best way to do that.  But for sure, the end results will be done as a white paper.  I have some (INCREDIBLE) people trying to help me get a hook into Usahidi to do bi-directional in-outs on the requests found and mapped so we end the duplication of fulfilment by adding a "Fulfiled" tag to the requests that have been completed.  Not there yet, but close.  none of this would be possible were it not for SBTF and a bunch of other volunteer orgs that suport SBTF.  Again I thank you all very much, you are assisting in the prevention of loss of life and property with what you do.  !Steve

<<< Indonesia issues tsunami warning after #quake near #Sumatra, Reuters reports.
http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/10/7-3-magnitude-quake-strikes-off-indonesia/
There were no immediate reports of damage.

The Indonesian government issued a tsunami warning after the quake, according to Reuters.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says a destructive widespread tsunami threat "does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data."

"However, there is a very small possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than 100 kilometers from the earthquake epicenter," a PTWC bulletin said.
ok, that should end that..
lots of tweets, just picking out the tsunami warning.. not really the complete/true story
the end.

A highschool friend of mine (persian refugee) is setting something up against that regime in persian and english and I wanted to get in touch with anyone who wanted to help with the mapping element.

[1/19/2012 11:25:29 AM] om SBTF: The objective truth, put on a map, isn't for or against anything ;) If it just so hapens that the facts are uncomfortable for a regime, or highlight intolerable conditions and rally support for subjugated people's then.. so be it. :)

[1/19/2012 3:54:11 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Activities related to Iran have been historically very tight and closed security/internet-wise as I'm sure you know.
[1/19/2012 3:57:15 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: The dangers for those inside who seek our help continues to be as extreme as in 2009.  Executions are still not uncommon to say the least.
[1/19/2012 3:58:56 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Joseph, has your friend been in touch with anyone involved in the twitter green movement.
[1/19/2012 4:00:00 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: My work with them was/is primarily under the user @HelpIranHeal in terms of 1stAid.

[1/19/2012 4:11:45 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: All that's left there is Twitter archive from 2009, but your friend may also want to contact them.
[1/19/2012 4:12:25 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: My introduction to Small World News was from one of their first mapping efforts, Alive in Afghanistam.

[1/20/2012 2:00:22 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: That is the one of the kind of possibilities that makes Iran especially sensitive.  And the work on Twitter truly became a cyber-war as far as the gov't was concerned.
[1/20/2012 3:05:08 PM] josephrichardpollack: Hi all. just had a talk with my buddy. he won't get a site up until May early june. That sucks because of the elections in three weeks. He told me a bit about sources that he has and they're really exciting but too sensitive to share. On the plus side he knows a lot of people that may help with translation and can probably motivate people to start sending news in. If anyone is doing a map - those people can be assets to a team already active : I'm thinking aliveinteheran and the Balatarin guys. Any active projects do let me know!

[2/10/2012 5:51:33 PM] [SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: No fewer than 400 children have died of lead poisoning in northern part of the country, the Human Rights Watch has said. The areas affected include villages such as Abare, Dareta, Duza, Sunke, Tungar Daji, Tungar Guru and Yargalma in Zamfara State, with the mortality rate estimated as high as 40 per cent among children who showed symptoms of lead poisoning. The organisation said this at a news conference in Lagos on Tuesday, adding that thousands of children in northern states would need immediate medical treatment. According to HRW representative in Nigeria, Jane Cohen, dozens of villages in Zamfara State were contaminated since two years by lead, spreading epidemic across the community. While releasing the video on the issue, Cohen said 400 children had died, according to official estimates, yet environmental clean-up efforts had not even begun in numerous affected villages. Human Rights Watch said that Artisanal gold mines were found throughout Zamfara State, in north-western Nigeria, and high levels of lead in the earth and the use of rudimentary mining methods had resulted in an epidemic of lead poisoning among children. Research by Human Rights Watch also showed that children were exposed to this lead dust when they processed ore in the mines, when their miner relatives returned home covered with lead dust, and when the lead-filled ore is manually or mechanically crushed at home.

<<< At least 14 people died in floods triggered by torrential rains in Peru, authorities said. Heavy rains battered the country for the past two days. Thousands of people were left homeless, officials said Thursday. The San Martin province has been the hardest hit. Rains have caused rivers to overflow. Transportation links to many towns in the country's 22 provinces were cut off. The government has so far provided about 92 tonnes of emergency aid.

[2/25/2012 9:34:20 PM] Ellen Kay Endriss: @AshleighT - Welcome to SBTF! I'm very interested in your work and would like to ask if you would be willing to talk about it on Skype with my high school statistics students sometime, maybe May or June. Have sent a personal contact request so we can discuss further. ~Kay

The more experiments you make the better. What if they are a little coarse, and you may get your coat soiled or torn? What if you do fail, and get fairly rolled in the dirt once or twice. Up again, you shall never be so afraid of a tumble.

[2/29/2012 4:44:11 PM] Sara Farmer: I've received this, which is likely to become part of a pretty important speech about crisismapping. The suggestion is for us to crowdsource improving the scenario...
[2/29/2012 4:44:47 PM] Sara Farmer:  Imagine a refugee camp, a few years from now. Its late in the afternoon, and the mid-day heat has started to die down. People are relaxing outside their shelters  a patchwork of insecticide-treated tarps, local materials, and breezeblocks made from rubble packed into wire baskets.
The women are preparing an evening meal made from a corn-soya blend on a simple solar stove, bought from the camp committee with a Red Cross mobile cash-transfer. They are using water drawn from a nearby borehole, cleaned with a personal charcoal filtration system.
The children are playing and sending messages to each other on a cheap touchscreen smartphone, which their father has just finished charging on a jerry-rigged car battery. He used to use a personal solar panel, but sold it to the guy who runs the internet cafe.
On the screen, the children can see their camp in real time. The picture is streamed from a camera mounted on a large balloon, tethered to the radio mast. Hassan notices a fight breaking out round the back of the school tent. Its the local gang, and they are trying to rob his friend. 
Gang fight at back of #myrefugeecamp school tent, he send out, on his twitter feed. The message springs up on everyones map. The camp safety committee spots it, and sends someone to the scene. An NGO official in the nearest town calls the committee, and asks if they need help.
Thanks, but weve got it covered, the committee answers. Good news, says the NGO official. See you next week!
[2/29/2012 4:44:51 PM] Sara Farmer: -- Any ideas?
[2/29/2012 4:45:47 PM] Sara Farmer: (if you think it's lame, then please help to improve it)

[3/1/2012 11:39:48 AM] Melissa Elliott: I also love the concept.  but is it realistic?  will the audience believe that this is possible?
[3/1/2012 11:42:15 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: people believe in the crisis mapping.. reputable orgs
[3/1/2012 11:42:33 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: of course how to vet the source
[3/1/2012 11:43:09 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: unless there were vetted sources embeded in the "camps" or where ever we are mapping

[3/1/2012 6:15:53 PM] Sara Farmer: I'm planning to run some as part of the Crisismappers NYC meetup.
[3/1/2012 6:16:36 PM] Sara Farmer: A bunch of us (Sophia Liu, Timothie and some of the grassroots mappers) went to the OSM meetup last night and persuaded them to put on a training session too.
[3/1/2012 6:18:13 PM] Sara Farmer: It's the same stuff that Crisiscamp London used to do - and probably still does under its ICT4D moniker.
[3/1/2012 6:18:52 PM] Sara Farmer: And it's much needed - we had people turning up at the OSM meeting asking about how to use Ushahidi, and wanting to link us to the local disaster response networks.
[3/2/2012 10:20:25 AM] Melissa Elliott: Met Sophia Liu's new boss this week :)  Exciting stuff for her!
[3/2/2012 1:42:48 PM] Sara Farmer: Yay! She's in New York at the moment, and making a great impression on the locals!

[3/18/2012 3:38:25 PM] Melissa Elliott: In case you didn't see the email sent yesterday:
[3/18/2012 3:38:36 PM] Melissa Elliott: Dear all,

We will be running a training session on analysis for SBTF deployments. This training is open to all volunteers - whether or not you are a member of the Analysis Team.

There will be two time slots for the training: March 31 5am - 9am EST and March 31 12pm - 4pm EST. If you are interested in participating in this training, please sign up here by March 22.

We welcome volunteers with any skill set and any level of experience. You will be asked to work in teams during the training session, and we will try to put together balanced teams. The training will focus on sharing tools that are commonly used. Each team will then be asked to use these tools (and anything else they can come up with) to produce a report using the standard Task Force Report Template that we have used in previous deployments.

Although we are calling this a training, we also hope it will be a way to generate new ideas on how to do analysis. There is no one right answer on how to do analysis during a deployment, and we look forward to adding your creative ideas to our toolkit for future deployments!

Any questions, please email helena@standbytaskforce.com or diana@standbytaskforce.com

Best,

Helena & Diana

[3/24/2012 3:01:04 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: you got other thoughts?
[3/25/2012 8:45:02 PM] Shadrock Roberts: Hi all, sorry to crash the heatmap discussion, but I'd like to urge caution using heat-map widgets and plug ins. I seen them used a lot and, often, are inappropriate for the data or are created in such a way that you can't actually tell what the data mean. One good example is here: http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/cartographic_malpractice.pdf
[3/25/2012 8:47:25 PM] Shadrock Roberts: There are a lot of underlying spatial decisions that are made when creating these types of maps (e.g. the size of the raster grid) which have a *huge* affect on the way the data are presented and understood. The ESRI Module for the spatial analyst extension touches on this somewhat.
[3/25/2012 8:52:56 PM] Shadrock Roberts: It's a pay course, but is a good place to start: http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.webCourseDetail&CourseID=1404.

[4/17/2012 9:05:03 AM] Michael: analysis and geoloc

[4/17/2012 9:05:39 AM] Michael: lol
[4/17/2012 9:06:28 AM] Melissa Elliott: K - Heather & Michael - if you sign up we'll place you on a team.  IF YOU"RE VERY LUCKY, it might be the Reports team
[4/17/2012 9:06:45 AM] Michael: yea
[4/17/2012 9:49:38 AM] Sara Farmer: I can't do Saturday (big data hackathon) - would I still be welcome on the other days?
[4/17/2012 9:50:49 AM] Sara Farmer: And can I mark up a bunch of time slots when I could be available, and have them allocated so I'm not doing them all, or do I tick only the timeslots that I want to work?
[4/17/2012 9:52:02 AM] *** crisner has left ***
[4/17/2012 9:53:46 AM] Hilary Nicole: @mellonely I think i signed up already when this was first announced, is there a way to check before submitting a duplicate?
[4/17/2012 9:54:24 AM] Michael: was askining same question as Sara  about timeslots if am aloud to check more time slots
[4/17/2012 9:54:35 AM] Sara Farmer: And where's the list of teams being deployed?  I'm looking on the ning page at http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/events/humanitarian-studies-simulation-exercise?rsvpConfirm=1
[4/17/2012 9:55:05 AM] Hilary Nicole: (in terms of team selection if we are members of multiple teams can we select which to work with during the simulation?)
[4/17/2012 9:55:30 AM] Hilary Nicole: @SBTF leaders ---> follow-up question to no one in specific....
[4/17/2012 9:57:13 AM] Sara Farmer: Hmm... my two cents is that it's good to be with a single team (more stable), but that a) you get more experience if you switch between teams (no working multiple teams at once if possible), and b) loadings might mean that some teams will need 'surge' capacity when others are light.
[4/17/2012 10:04:52 AM] Hilary Nicole: understood
[4/17/2012 10:10:07 AM] Sara Farmer: It's a very interesting question - Melissa? Anahi? Are you here?
[4/17/2012 10:11:07 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: hey all
[4/17/2012 10:12:18 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: ok, so for this simuation you will not chose your team, we wil assign you.the reason is not that we want to be bossy (eheh) but just that we had a lot of times problems with one team full of people and another one empty, and switch people around suring work especially if you need to train them in multiple teams is a waste of time
[4/17/2012 10:12:56 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: so short answer: no, you can't, but if we will need someone to switch to, we will ask people that are from multile teams aready
[4/17/2012 10:12:58 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: :)
[4/17/2012 10:13:01 AM] Hilary Nicole: ok and the ning site is where we can see/change which time blocks we have signed up for?
[4/17/2012 10:13:16 AM] Hilary Nicole: good to know thanks
[4/17/2012 10:13:26 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: we will send this out super soon, as soon as we have assigned all the volunteers to the teams
[4/17/2012 10:51:41 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/group/hsisimulation
[4/17/2012 10:51:48 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: To start :)
[4/17/2012 10:55:18 AM] Hilary Nicole: awesome --- it is all EST correct? gmt-5?
[4/17/2012 10:55:26 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: EST
[4/17/2012 10:55:28 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: all est
[4/17/2012 10:56:36 AM] Hilary Nicole: great thanks! looking forward to it I'll look for your email updates. have a good day all
[4/17/2012 10:56:39 AM] anahi ayala iacucci: we are assigning people today and tomorrow and then you will find all in the spreasheet
[4/17/2012 10:57:50 AM] jeremyb: there's no EST in boston at the moment. please either use ET or EDT instead
[4/17/2012 10:58:08 AM] jeremyb: so, UTC-4 not -5
[4/17/2012 10:58:47 AM] Melissa Elliott: Hi Hilary - yes, we have you :)
[4/17/2012 11:03:12 AM] Melissa Elliott: Hey Hilary - I have a question for you
[4/17/2012 11:03:22 AM] Hilary Nicole: yup
[4/17/2012 11:03:33 AM] Melissa Elliott: can you accept my contact request
[4/17/2012 11:03:39 AM] Melissa Elliott: (that's not the question btw ;)
[4/17/2012 11:03:40 AM] Hilary Nicole: can you resend i dont see it
[4/17/2012 11:04:14 AM] jeremyb: (better yet if your audience is a large chunk of the world and not just people in the US then use UTC)
[4/17/2012 11:07:09 AM] Hilary Nicole: does anyone have a god map of the time zones? I always get confused and it would be a lot easier for have a solid reference when planning meetings in general
[4/17/2012 11:07:20 AM] shawnleecl: don't rely on maps 
[4/17/2012 11:07:35 AM] shawnleecl: some countries leave the actual timezone in favor of another
[4/17/2012 11:07:36 AM] jeremyb: just make a list of tzdata timezones
[4/17/2012 11:07:39 AM] Hilary Nicole: or a reference
[4/17/2012 11:08:26 AM] jeremyb: you can then use something like this:
$ for TZ in UTC Pacific/{Auckland,Honolulu} Asia/Seoul Africa/{Monrovia,Nairobi} America/{Los_Angeles,New_York} Europe/{London,Berlin,Helsinki}; do printf '%-20s ' "${TZ}:"; echo $(TZ="${TZ}" date -d @1335830400) $(TZ="${TZ}" date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' -d @1335830400); done | { IFS= ; head -n 1; echo; sort -k 8; unset IFS; } | perl -lpe 's/\s+\S+\s+\S+$//;'; unset TZ;

[4/17/2012 11:09:39 AM] jeremyb: (i guess maybe I should make a webapp for that ;P)
[4/17/2012 11:10:46 AM] Hilary Nicole: i wont complain if you do, not at all!
[4/17/2012 11:11:01 AM] Hilary Nicole: i usually rely on the google calander since it allows you to select time zones
[4/17/2012 11:11:02 AM] Heather Leson: I use http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html and foxclocks
[4/17/2012 11:11:22 AM] diana.sinton: meanwhile, for those of us who rely on others app, this is a simple web interface. http://www.timezonecheck.com/
[4/17/2012 11:13:07 AM] Hilary Nicole: thanks Heather & Diana, very useful
[4/17/2012 11:38:06 AM] matteo.beltramin: done
[4/17/2012 7:21:07 PM] Sara Farmer: Major Yay! I got the Skype4Py link working... mwhh hahhh hahh, the plan to add irc-style bots to our chats progresses...
[4/17/2012 8:14:18 PM] robbie.mackay: @Sara brilliant.. I messed about with some of the skype libraries a while back but it was painful. I was hoping for a skype IRC link .. so all the geeks could ditch skype altogether
[4/17/2012 10:08:02 PM] *** Melissa Elliott added Kevin Waterman ***
[4/17/2012 10:09:14 PM] Melissa Elliott: Hi everyone.  Please welcome Kevin Waterman to the SBTF.  Kevin is an emergency management consultant with over 20 years experience in the emergency services field. He's a former Queensland and Royal Australian Navy fire fighter and holds a Bachelor of Social Science (Emergency Management), Graduate Certificate in Terrorism, Safety and Security and a Graduate Diploma of Community Development (Emergency Management).
[4/17/2012 10:09:56 PM] Melissa Elliott: Kevin is on the Media Monitoring, Humanitarian & Task Teams  and is based in Brisbane, Australia

[4/17/2012 10:10:32 PM] Melissa Elliott: Welcome to the team Kevin!
[4/17/2012 10:12:13 PM] Marta Poblet: Hi Kevin, welcome to the SBTF! :)
[4/18/2012 3:58:22 AM] Sara Farmer: @Robbie - it's been painful for me too... but once I got past the Skype-not-talking-to-Windows-64bit thing, it was all very very simple. So far, i've made lists of which country everyone active in a chat is from and sent a message to a Skypechat from python... next I want to draw down an hour's messages and do some simple natural language processing on them.
[4/18/2012 3:58:59 AM] Sara Farmer: I still have to fix the not-working-from-windows-64bit thing, but at least i can get all the functions designed and tested now.
[4/18/2012 3:59:52 AM] Sara Farmer: And Kevin - hello! Good to see an Aussie in here... you'll be much needed in the wee small EST hours...
[4/18/2012 4:10:34 AM] Shawn Lee: hey hey one from Singapore here too
[4/18/2012 4:10:48 AM] Shawn Lee: just about  hours behind you guys
[4/18/2012 4:10:52 AM] Shawn Lee: *2 hours
[4/18/2012 4:31:38 AM] Sara Farmer: Cool... getting closer to round-the-world here...
[4/18/2012 1:57:06 PM] robbie.mackay: @Sara I don't run windows.. linux has its own issues. My end goal was to have something I could run on a server somewhere.
[4/18/2012 1:57:50 PM] robbie.mackay: @Sara even just creating some skype chat logs for all the different chats would be great.
[4/18/2012 2:17:50 PM] Sara Farmer: @Robbie - am doing what I can.  Have to do some dayjob stuff today, then back to it again.
[4/18/2012 2:26:06 PM] Robbie MacKay: :) fair enough.. its dropped off my todolist entirely for the moment

[4/26/2012 3:01:44 PM] Christina@info4disasters: Welcome David and Gianluca!
[4/26/2012 3:01:51 PM] Christina@info4disasters: Happy Birthday Melissa!
[4/26/2012 3:04:38 PM] om SBTF: @thisistausif @Patrick Meier
[4/26/2012 3:06:17 PM] om SBTF: WHO has an excellent animal tracking database that can export position information. I'd be surprised if some ESRI package wasn't already being used to plot this out for the in-department strategists.
[4/26/2012 3:08:23 PM] Sara Farmer: Animal tracking?  Erika from the NYC UNICEF innovations lab has been building lion tracking collars etc for a while now - were they looking for tracks, or for tracking devices?
[4/26/2012 3:16:50 PM] om SBTF: it's an overall data management system to record and monitor animal health status around the world. Not collars (but those sound like fun   :$  (angel)  )
[4/26/2012 3:17:36 PM] Heather Leson: www.globalanimalwelfare.org too - we have a community member in ushahidi land doing stuff
[4/26/2012 3:30:40 PM] Sara Farmer: THat would be scottish rocket boy?  Yes - is very committed to it.
[4/27/2012 9:36:56 AM] ellen feig: Anyone available for report team for simulation today from 2 to 5?
[4/27/2012 9:37:31 AM] Sara Farmer: anyone available for SMS team now?
[4/27/2012 9:42:23 AM] Jeannine Lemaire: @Sara I can help out
[4/27/2012 9:42:38 AM] Jeannine Lemaire: Leading GL team but without SMS reports GL team can't do anything anyhow :D
[4/27/2012 9:45:55 AM] Sara Farmer: Thanks Jeannine!
[4/27/2012 9:53:21 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: who's the geoloc coordinator?
[4/27/2012 9:55:06 AM] Sara Farmer: Jeannine?  There isn't one listeed in the schedule.
[4/27/2012 9:56:10 AM] Jeannine Lemaire: I'm GL coordinator right now (10 am - 12pm)
[4/27/2012 10:20:53 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: can u please add me to simulation window.. thank you!
[4/27/2012 2:25:47 PM] Arlene Ducao: Hello dear SBTF, I wanted to post a last minute plug for my infrared mapping project, which is up for a "community choice" award (meaning, votes from you) in the MIT IDEAS Global Challenge: http://globalchallenge.mit.edu/teams/view/242
We'd love your vote and any feedback, too.
[4/27/2012 3:24:49 PM] Melissa Elliott: Chris Planicka & Abdi Ali - we're hoping to see you check in for your 4pm shift on the simulation
[4/27/2012 9:31:31 PM] om SBTF: Hi Y'all! I'm at the camp. Jeannine, can you jump me into the sim window  (inlove)
[4/27/2012 9:41:58 PM] om SBTF: jeannine?
[4/28/2012 5:27:34 PM] om SBTF: hello?
[4/28/2012 5:27:44 PM] om SBTF: how is everybody?
[4/28/2012 5:28:19 PM] om SBTF: I'm trying to get into the Sim window... I'm at the camp and it is going to be a loong night
[4/29/2012 9:07:12 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Hope you got in @om
[4/29/2012 9:31:56 PM] om SBTF: Yep Donna, thanks a lot. It was really valuable to see the information patterns while on the ground. We have a lot of processing to do to handle any 'real' situation in a country with an active phone network ;)
[4/29/2012 9:45:54 PM] Melissa Elliott: Om - can you expand on what you're saying please?
[4/30/2012 6:55:42 AM] om SBTF: Should something major happen pretty much anywhere from here forward, the likelyhood that we will be able to receive message bursts in the thousands is only going to grow. The methodology that we operate with is hampered by the technology we are using and the number of people who choose to participate. I see two problems here. One is that we typically scale our capacity to reflect the number of bodies available and see attrition as some mysterious force rather than really exploring how to facilitate a relationship with volunteers that plays to crowdsourcing's strengths (I see these strengths as: quick response with a lot of small contributions, and the potential for highly trained individuals to jump in for a short time as their other priorities allow). On the technology front, again, we are playing to the existing tech platforms that 'we' have chosen to use and limited our processes and thinking to fit the limitations of Ushahidi+Skype+Gdocs rather than putting energy into refining a methodology that will be able to handle a real world crisis in the manner that we would want to do. So now, rather than create and use SMS (which is arguably the most useful and prevalent means of crowdsourcing in most scenario's - and will only increase in relevance as smaller cell network hardware like Tethr'd comes to the field) we tend to limit our inputs to match the coordinator's estimation of what we can handle. Anahi asked me to put my opinions on the Ning and I will copy this over there for continued discussion.. but even that action is an example of how we need to improve methodology and how much valuable wisdom is lost in the stream.
[4/30/2012 7:38:38 AM] Heather Leson: I think he was in Boston on the ground. But, I can't wait to hear more -too. Melissa- are you feeling better?
[4/30/2012 7:52:03 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: my experience with this kind of work, om, is that expressed opinions often get lost. action, however, tends to stick around. if you can implement a pilot solution to some of the problems that you rightly point out, we may be on the way to finding a solution that sticks around.
[4/30/2012 10:14:24 AM] om SBTF: right, "if you can"... actions speak louder than words... Patrick encouraged me to start a Ning forum about the topic and it has had 6 visits and 0 responses in two months. My hope is not to pour out my own vision (which I am *obviously* happy to do :) ) but to generate a culture of innovative thinking that seeks to explore what we *can* do, what we need to accomplish good for the widest number of situations.
[4/30/2012 10:15:37 AM] om SBTF: we have a ton of individual frustrations that tend to be lost or not brought up, but I think it definitely impacts a person's willingness to engage or make crisis mapping a priority and from our perspective they just 'disappear'.
[4/30/2012 10:16:44 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: i fully agree. and i think what we need is a culture of innovative thought-to-action. think of a solution? great. write about it, by all means. and then take the initiative to pilot it.
[4/30/2012 10:16:48 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: let me give you an example:
[4/30/2012 10:17:38 AM] Sara Farmer: Om - what's the address of that forum?
[4/30/2012 10:17:39 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: i found that with the analysis team it was very furstrating to sit around waiting for work. so for this deployment (and for the training) we instead organized volunteers into teams with specific deliverables and specific deadlines. it worked quite well, i think.
[4/30/2012 10:18:11 AM] Helena Puig Larrauri: right, we should probably copy paste this in there :)
[4/30/2012 10:18:35 AM] om SBTF: http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/forum/topics/visioneering-exercise
[4/30/2012 10:20:08 AM] Sara Farmer: Ah - I didn't know it was there (I get busy periods sometimes, where emails can get overwhelming. No excuse, but if I don't respond, it's sometimes because the email got lost in a deluge)
[4/30/2012 10:20:22 AM] om SBTF: (forgive my spotty responses - I'm in class atm)
[4/30/2012 10:21:53 AM] om SBTF: @Helena the teams and deliverables worked well - within the constraints of our existing setup. It has been "what we have to work with" for ages though and we have quite a few examples of how quickly that system breaks down when certain persons are not involved or tasked on other things.
[4/30/2012 10:22:22 AM] om SBTF: I'm also happy to continue on the forum..
[4/30/2012 10:25:59 AM] Sara Farmer: OKay.  So indulge me in an idea for a moment.  Is it worth us having an "ideas team" that people can sign up to, and have long dicussions about different ideas for improvement, change, etc?
[4/30/2012 10:27:10 AM] Sara Farmer: For the moment, I'm going to start tagging forum discussions so we can sift through them.  It's a stopgap, but it's a start/.
[4/30/2012 10:28:03 AM] Sara Farmer: Which leads to another question. Which top-level tags do we want?
[4/30/2012 10:29:02 AM] om SBTF: well, I'd actually put an ideas bucket on the front page. Any barrier to entry seems to turn people off quicker and quicker, until all that's left are folks who maintain situational awareness by contstant maintenance.
[4/30/2012 10:29:06 AM] Sara Farmer: My first list is: idea. technology. training. academia. NGO. meeting. job.
[4/30/2012 10:29:44 AM] Sara Farmer: Well yes. We need an ideas bucket somewhere. But we also need to be able to engage people into it.
[4/30/2012 10:30:04 AM] Sara Farmer: Melissa (i.e. fellow co-ning-manager): are you around this morning, or still in the grip of 'flu?
[4/30/2012 10:30:30 AM] om SBTF: that's why I suggested an icon, like a big red dot, that denotes conversations about making this ongoing experiment more effective, relevant to each deoployment and even a larger discussion about overarching *ideal* functioning.
[4/30/2012 10:34:49 AM] Sara Farmer: OM - if you can find some Ning features that can help us, I'm all ears.  I have to go work in a bit, but I'm going to try to upgrade the Ning forum a bit (at least get some categories or tag clouds on it) first before I start.
[4/30/2012 10:47:36 AM] Sara Farmer: Right. Om: you now have a whole category for "ideas and improvements".  Please keep reminding us periodically that it's there, and I for one will try to add my own ideas into it for you.
[4/30/2012 10:49:45 AM] Heather Leson: will there be an aar call?
[4/30/2012 11:09:51 AM] Sara Farmer: Okay. The SBTF forum is now organised: categories are Training, Deployments, NGO Collaboration, Ideas and Improvements, Meetings and Meetups, and Uncategorised (for things that don't fit into any of the above).  Further suggestions are welcome: page is http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/forum
[4/30/2012 11:31:59 AM] om SBTF: Thx Sara. @Heather, I know Roz was discussing this, but not sure what she had planned
[4/30/2012 11:34:41 AM] Heather Leson: here is what I am talking about = community features for realtime mapping - http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/04/30/relaunching-occupymap-for-may-day/
[4/30/2012 11:39:33 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: @om. We can help facilitate an ideas portal from the info4 frontpage, weather by linking or tunneling to the bucket via tag.
[4/30/2012 11:40:22 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (ha...weather is on my mind)
[4/30/2012 11:40:34 AM] Sara Farmer: @Donna - the more ideas, the better. We need to start gathering them, and addressing each of them as a group.
[4/30/2012 11:42:33 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: would be great to decide on a starting tag right now
[4/30/2012 11:42:51 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: get the ball rolling
[4/30/2012 11:42:57 AM] Sara Farmer: Tag?  As in "ideas"?
[4/30/2012 11:43:32 AM] om SBTF: @Donna, Sara worked her magic and made one already
[4/30/2012 11:44:19 AM] Sara Farmer: I'm trying to build a Drupal-based ideas management tool at the moment - but I'm looking at the Occupy ideas page and thinking that it could be modified well.  But for the moment, having a forum category for ideas on the Ning site should be enough for us to keep discussions going.
[4/30/2012 11:44:21 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: @Om & @sara...see what I get for jumping down the thread!
[4/30/2012 11:44:41 AM] Sara Farmer: http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/forum/categories/ideas-and-improvements/listForCategory

[5/1/2012 10:41:25 AM] Michael: true

[5/1/2012 10:55:02 AM] Michael: Kony is a rebel leader
[5/1/2012 10:55:39 AM] Michael: who has been terrorising trshe people of Northen Uganda for the couple of 23-24 ye
[5/1/2012 10:56:07 AM] Michael: he was ousted by govt forces around 2005
[5/1/2012 10:56:55 AM] Michael: but hez group used to cut off peoples, lips, abduct children and use them as soldiers, girls were taken on as wives for the war lords

[5/1/2012 10:57:17 AM] Michael: president of Sudan
[5/1/2012 10:57:33 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: Oh,, horrible, Michael

[5/1/2012 10:58:14 AM] Michael: so this was some kind of proxie war where Bashir backed Kony and Uganda backed SPLM, the current govt in South Sudan
[5/1/2012 10:58:20 AM] Michael: yea
[5/1/2012 10:58:44 AM] Michael: Bashir is the current president of Sudan,
[5/1/2012 10:59:29 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: I am grateful for you explaining this so clearly for me.. (hug)
[5/1/2012 10:59:30 AM] Michael: so conflict between the two Sudans. ie South sudan and Sudan automatically involves Uganda
[5/1/2012 10:59:44 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: (shake)
[5/1/2012 11:00:23 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: I am sorry.. please keep me updated.. so just these past few days things are getting r ougher in South Sudan?
[5/1/2012 11:00:31 AM] Michael: yea
[5/1/2012 11:00:55 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: has something happened to escalate the violence?
[5/1/2012 11:01:02 AM] Michael: South Sudan seceded from Sudan about 11 months back,
[5/1/2012 11:01:22 AM] Michael: now the conflict is about control of the Oil Rich borders
[5/1/2012 11:01:33 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: yes, I workedd here with the elections.
[5/1/2012 11:01:54 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: OIL RICH BORDERS.. yes, oil is always involved somewhere..
[5/1/2012 11:02:17 AM] Michael: most of the Oil is in the South however the North has most of the infrastructure
[5/1/2012 11:03:10 AM] Michael: so South Sudn  wants to build an oil pipe line linking it to Kenya other than enrouting it s oil via North Sudan
[5/1/2012 11:03:59 AM] Michael: so a couple of days Back South Sudan took control of an oil Rich border area called Heglig definetely people lost lives
[5/1/2012 11:04:33 AM] Michael: later they with drew how ever Aerial bombardment of the south have been witnessed
[5/1/2012 11:05:02 AM] Michael: LEESA....its all GEOPOLITICS at play

[5/1/2012 11:06:42 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: money and oil.. same ole same ole all the time.. doesnt anyone ever think of the human beings that get involved? I guess they just dont care..

[5/1/2012 11:09:09 AM] Michael: this is the coz for lots of conflict  now because of our untammed desire to consume resources
[5/1/2012 11:10:04 AM] Michael: not yert

[5/1/2012 11:14:21 AM] Christina@info4disasters: people get arms and legs cut off for them
[5/1/2012 11:14:49 AM] Michael: infact the Central African Region now is home to most of the UNTOUCHED NATURAL  RESOURCES OF THIS WORLD
[5/1/2012 11:14:53 AM] shawnleecl: folks
[5/1/2012 11:15:02 AM] Michael: so who ever controls it
[5/1/2012 11:15:03 AM] shawnleecl: on this note I'd like to chime in with a question
[5/1/2012 11:15:10 AM] Michael: has it all
[5/1/2012 11:15:16 AM] shawnleecl: would you guys rather give the press and your citizens the full freedom
[5/1/2012 11:15:23 AM] shawnleecl: unrestrained constituitional right to free speech
[5/1/2012 11:15:39 AM] Christina@info4disasters: press needs to have free speech
[5/1/2012 11:15:40 AM] shawnleecl: without laws that prohibit what may be said
[5/1/2012 11:15:43 AM] Michael: bring it on shawn
[5/1/2012 11:15:44 AM] shawnleecl: _OR_
[5/1/2012 11:15:46 AM] Christina@info4disasters: but it's not reality unfortunately
[5/1/2012 11:16:02 AM] shawnleecl: they have the right to free speech HOWEVER there are out-of-bound markers such as racial lines
[5/1/2012 11:16:09 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: [Tuesday, May 01, 2012 11:14 AM] Michael: 

<<< infact the Central African Region now is home to most of the UNTOUCHED NATURAL  RESOURCES OF THIS WORLD (clap)
[5/1/2012 11:16:13 AM] shawnleecl: or laws that prevent inciting sectarian tensions, etc.
[5/1/2012 11:16:34 AM] shawnleecl: take for example Westboro Baptist
[5/1/2012 11:16:52 AM] shawnleecl: I believe the did step on other religon's toes (and/or played the race card)
[5/1/2012 11:17:02 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: I am all for freedom of the press if they report accuracy of events and NOT opinions.
[5/1/2012 11:17:22 AM] shawnleecl: well Leesa
[5/1/2012 11:17:30 AM] shawnleecl: how exactly do you report events without opinions?
[5/1/2012 11:17:42 AM] shawnleecl: no matter what, there will be emotions involved
[5/1/2012 11:17:44 AM] Michael: From a developing country perspective Shawn we need press freedom  coz most of our people are illiterate they can;t read or right so the press is the only source of information
[5/1/2012 11:17:56 AM] shawnleecl: and where emotions are involved, opinions will inevitably be formed
[5/1/2012 11:18:01 AM] shawnleecl: and will be present, whether subtly so or not
[5/1/2012 11:18:32 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: facts.. but yes of course some emotions to be involved.. I am  not for guiding public opinion though,.
[5/1/2012 11:19:00 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: brb.. gotta go have a (smoking) break..
[5/1/2012 11:19:04 AM] shawnleecl: but clamping down on the press *may* bring more stability
[5/1/2012 11:19:18 AM] shawnleecl: of course restraint has to be exercised on the Government's part as well
[5/1/2012 11:19:35 AM] shawnleecl: alt. restraining rights to protest
[5/1/2012 11:19:43 AM] shawnleecl: and to that end the country may develop faster
[5/1/2012 11:19:47 AM] shawnleecl: and then open up
[5/1/2012 11:19:48 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: facsinating convos here today.. I will BRB
[5/1/2012 11:20:01 AM] shawnleecl: of course this is all dependent on a responsible government  not many exist.
[5/1/2012 11:20:17 AM] Michael: spot on  Shawn
[5/1/2012 11:20:30 AM] shawnleecl: and don't get me wrong too, I'm all for freedom of the press, etc.. But looking at the way my country has done things (Singapore)
[5/1/2012 11:20:38 AM] shawnleecl: I hate to admit it but... it did work
[5/1/2012 11:20:52 AM] Michael: sure
[5/1/2012 11:21:10 AM] Michael: Shawn some times its necessary to control the press
[5/1/2012 11:21:13 AM] shawnleecl: back then we had the commies trying to come in
[5/1/2012 11:21:25 AM] shawnleecl: political parties were formed on racial lines
[5/1/2012 11:21:29 AM] shawnleecl: protests all over, etc.
[5/1/2012 11:21:38 AM] Michael: for instance i bring up t wat transpired in Rwanda Genocide
[5/1/2012 11:21:40 AM] shawnleecl: that was around 1965?
[5/1/2012 11:21:53 AM] Michael: where the press contributed to this genocide
[5/1/2012 11:22:06 AM] shawnleecl: and since the 1990s we were (and still are) one of the most developed economies out here in Asia  and one of America's staunchest allies
[5/1/2012 11:22:27 AM] shawnleecl: ahh, didn't know that Michael
[5/1/2012 11:23:05 AM] Michael: go search what happened in Rwanda
[5/1/2012 11:23:12 AM] shawnleecl: do believe this would be an enlightening take on things too
[5/1/2012 11:23:13 AM] shawnleecl: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Singapore
[5/1/2012 11:23:16 AM] shawnleecl: and yes I will Michael
[5/1/2012 11:23:21 AM] Michael: the press was at the centre of it all
[5/1/2012 11:23:48 AM] Michael: am sori i cant post links
[5/1/2012 11:24:03 AM] Christina@info4disasters: there isn't really any free press, it's controlled
[5/1/2012 11:24:04 AM] Michael: coz ma internet is failing to open other pages
[5/1/2012 11:24:27 AM] shawnleecl: oh here's another  privately owned press or state funded press
[5/1/2012 11:24:44 AM] shawnleecl: on one hand state funded press could be manipulated to become the government mouthpiece
[5/1/2012 11:24:57 AM] shawnleecl: but same can be said by the privately owned  all you need to do is pay them well enough, and they become your mouth piece!
[5/1/2012 11:25:14 AM] Michael: lol
[5/1/2012 11:25:18 AM] Christina@info4disasters: you need to look at who is behind
[5/1/2012 11:25:26 AM] shawnleecl: just look at Fox News
[5/1/2012 11:25:29 AM] Christina@info4disasters: who owns the networks
[5/1/2012 11:25:33 AM] shawnleecl: or basically the state of networks in the US
[5/1/2012 11:25:36 AM] Christina@info4disasters: that's what you have to look at
[5/1/2012 11:26:00 AM] shawnleecl: honestly I'm in envy of the BBC
[5/1/2012 11:26:04 AM] shawnleecl: or even Al Jazeera
[5/1/2012 11:26:14 AM] shawnleecl: state funded but look at their reporting
[5/1/2012 11:26:17 AM] shawnleecl: top notch
[5/1/2012 11:26:23 AM] Christina@info4disasters: these might be one of the few
[5/1/2012 11:26:26 AM] Michael: well shwan
[5/1/2012 11:26:35 AM] Christina@info4disasters: they are not controlled by the US moguls
[5/1/2012 11:26:39 AM] Michael: i would say not put your eggs in one basket
[5/1/2012 11:27:10 AM] shawnleecl: contrast it with the media here... Privately owned (technically speaking) but the stakeholders are government SWFs
[5/1/2012 11:27:27 AM] shawnleecl: and rarely critical of the government (though that's changing)
[5/1/2012 11:28:29 AM] Michael: one thing i ve trained myself to do is  to listen to mainstream media and read other peoples blogs to get an object view about an issue
[5/1/2012 11:29:11 AM] Michael: other than tht main streaam media will report tht which "they" want you to know or read
[5/1/2012 11:29:21 AM] shawnleecl: yeah
[5/1/2012 11:29:28 AM] shawnleecl: diversify your news sources
[5/1/2012 11:29:37 AM] Michael: thts the way to go
[5/1/2012 11:30:11 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: back
[5/1/2012 11:30:19 AM] Michael: well be back
[5/1/2012 11:30:28 AM] Michael: ma (coffee)
[5/1/2012 11:30:38 AM] Michael: Leesa
[5/1/2012 11:30:58 AM] shawnleecl: back to Singapore as an example..
[5/1/2012 11:31:02 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: [Tuesday, May 01, 2012 11:26 AM] Shawn Lee: 

<<< honestly I'm in envy of the BBC
or even Al Jazeeraexcellent reporting here
[5/1/2012 11:31:03 AM] shawnleecl: The Economist Intelligence Unit classifies Singapore as a "hybrid" country, with authoritarian and democratic elements. Freedom House does not consider Singapore an "electoral democracy" and ranks the country as "partly free". Reporters Without Borders ranked Singapore 140th out of 167 countries in its 2005 Press Freedom Index.[2]


It has also been alleged that the PAP employs censorship, gerrymandering and the filing of civil suits against the opposition for libel or slander to impede their success.
[5/1/2012 11:31:19 AM] shawnleecl: Although dominant in its activities, the government has a clean, corruption-free image. Singapore has consistently been rated as the least-corrupt country in Asia and amongst the top ten cleanest in the world by Transparency International.[4][5] The World Bank's governance indicators have also rated Singapore highly on rule of law, control of corruption and government effectiveness.
[5/1/2012 11:31:51 AM] shawnleecl: HDI is at 0.846, 26th in the world
[5/1/2012 11:32:07 AM] shawnleecl: GDP per capita is 13th in the world
[5/1/2012 11:32:15 AM] Michael: some one should search about Uganda on all those you will be shocked
[5/1/2012 11:32:16 AM] Michael: lol
[5/1/2012 11:32:20 AM] shawnleecl: whoops sorry
[5/1/2012 11:32:25 AM] shawnleecl: GDP (PPP) per capita is 3rd
[5/1/2012 11:32:38 AM] shawnleecl: give and take, really
[5/1/2012 11:33:08 AM] Michael: shawn much as those figures are really good
[5/1/2012 11:33:18 AM] Michael: what are the realities on the ground
[5/1/2012 11:33:29 AM] shawnleecl: increasing inflation
[5/1/2012 11:33:34 AM] shawnleecl: at this current point in time
[5/1/2012 11:33:39 AM] shawnleecl: post-GFC
[5/1/2012 11:33:46 AM] Michael: for instance in UGanda the growth rate is high
[5/1/2012 11:34:02 AM] shawnleecl: ruling party believes in a liberal immigration policy
[5/1/2012 11:34:16 AM] shawnleecl: which has worked wonders in bringing growth/FDI
[5/1/2012 11:34:24 AM] shawnleecl: however in recent years it's been getting crowded
[5/1/2012 11:35:29 AM] shawnleecl: imagine an entire country with almost 6 million stuffed in an area slightly smaller than NYC
[5/1/2012 11:36:25 AM] shawnleecl: population's extremely educated
[5/1/2012 11:36:39 AM] shawnleecl: most have at least secondary school education
[5/1/2012 11:37:16 AM] shawnleecl: large majority also go on to universities (though many are discontented that we have to head overseas to study  there are limited spots in the local universities)
[5/1/2012 11:37:47 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: [Out of context at this point, but...Following your thread of fascinating dialogue here.  I do believe that there was a time when journalism and a journalistic creed were more, though not fully, but largely reliable despite ownership here in the States.  That has changed. Commercialism, ownership, monopolies turned independent due to regulations turning into monopolies all over again...and more powerful, more controlled, more politically slanted  than ever before, like FOX news.  But there was a creed, once upon a time, that somehow worked to a great extent...even within a reporters on emotions...Facts, only the Facts...no conclusions...no nuances.  Unfortunately that was a long time ago here in the States.  I do believe the BBC and AJ and PBS here are the most credible at this point.]
[5/1/2012 11:38:11 AM] shawnleecl: don't really peruse PBS so can't comment there
[5/1/2012 11:38:42 AM] shawnleecl: but yeah, BBC and AJ are fantastic at what they do
[5/1/2012 11:38:55 AM] shawnleecl: though I'm not sure about how AJ reports on local affairs..
[5/1/2012 11:39:02 AM] Michael: HEy friends the big QUESTION id what needs to be done now ???
[5/1/2012 11:39:04 AM] shawnleecl: BBC may be more of the exception than the norm
[5/1/2012 11:39:20 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Indeed.
[5/1/2012 11:39:35 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: \o/
[5/1/2012 11:39:40 AM] Michael: how should media shape up
[5/1/2012 11:39:41 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: Hi, @Donna!!
[5/1/2012 11:40:26 AM] Shawn Lee: it's tough, journalists need money after all
[5/1/2012 11:40:34 AM] Shawn Lee: and money has to come from somewhere
[5/1/2012 11:40:47 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: in case...to clarify...PBS is our "Public Broadcasting System"...not AS controlled, but still effected by changing regulations...changing with the party in power...
[5/1/2012 11:41:06 AM] Michael: so who are the people with the money ????
[5/1/2012 11:41:12 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Hi Leesa!
[5/1/2012 11:41:19 AM] Michael: Hi Donna
[5/1/2012 11:41:24 AM] Michael: (handshake)
[5/1/2012 11:41:32 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Hey Michael & Shawn!
[5/1/2012 11:41:46 AM] Shawn Lee: hi Donna!
[5/1/2012 11:42:17 AM] [HRT_SBTF]Leesa@info4disasters: we lost @Stina
[5/1/2012 11:42:38 AM] Michael: Stina
[5/1/2012 11:42:43 AM] Michael: wea are u
[5/1/2012 11:45:41 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: so who are the people with the money ????global corporations & their leaders (incl. finance of course), oil producing countries, and, at least in the US, pharmaceutical companies
forgive my ignorance if I left out anything
[5/1/2012 11:46:00 AM] Michael: good
[5/1/2012 11:46:04 AM] Shawn Lee: oh yes
[5/1/2012 11:46:09 AM] Shawn Lee: lobbyists are scary
[5/1/2012 11:46:20 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: very scary
[5/1/2012 11:46:22 AM] Michael: so then they will always control what ever we get in the media
[5/1/2012 11:46:26 AM] Shawn Lee: can't believe they allow that
[5/1/2012 11:46:54 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: neither do I
[5/1/2012 11:47:49 AM] Shawn Lee: on a totally seperate note..
[5/1/2012 11:47:53 AM] Shawn Lee: damn, I'm getting conscripted soon!
[5/1/2012 11:49:36 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Oh no!
[5/1/2012 11:50:21 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Are there non-military possibilities?
[5/1/2012 11:50:40 AM] Shawn Lee: well either way you get conscripted
[5/1/2012 11:50:45 AM] Shawn Lee: there are 3 branches
[5/1/2012 11:50:50 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 11:51:05 AM] Shawn Lee: the armed forces (military), civil defence (i.e. firefighters/paramedics) or the police force
[5/1/2012 11:51:26 AM] Shawn Lee: you're supposed to be assigned randomly into the 3 branches
[5/1/2012 11:51:40 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: just about to ask that
[5/1/2012 11:51:43 AM] Shawn Lee: (do note that there's further branching after that of course, i.e. air force/army/navy)
[5/1/2012 11:51:55 AM] Shawn Lee: and you can't request a specific branch at all
[5/1/2012 11:52:02 AM] Shawn Lee: there's an unofficial policy that
[5/1/2012 11:52:10 AM] Christina@info4disasters: agree Donna
[5/1/2012 11:52:22 AM] Christina@info4disasters: check out Disney, the background, who owns it, who controls it
[5/1/2012 11:52:30 AM] Shawn Lee: the Malays usually go to the CD branch and generally not the police force/military
[5/1/2012 11:52:34 AM] Shawn Lee: especially the military
[5/1/2012 11:52:34 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I am so sorry Shawn.
[5/1/2012 11:53:03 AM] Christina@info4disasters: @Leesa ?? we lost?
[5/1/2012 11:53:06 AM] Christina@info4disasters: I was away for a min
[5/1/2012 11:53:08 AM] Christina@info4disasters: sorry
[5/1/2012 11:53:21 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: The Malays would include you?
[5/1/2012 11:53:52 AM] Shawn Lee: however the policy stems from the fact that our neighbours are mostly Muslim nations  official position is that the Government doesn't wish to put them in a predicament when war comes. Cuz you can't kill fellow Muslims.
[5/1/2012 11:53:57 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Hey Christina!
[5/1/2012 11:54:08 AM] Shawn Lee: nope, I'm Chinese so I get the full blown military experience
[5/1/2012 11:54:18 AM] Shawn Lee: not too excited about it, physically demanding
[5/1/2012 11:54:18 AM] Shawn Lee: haha
[5/1/2012 11:54:24 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: ah...Malaysians (facepalm)
[5/1/2012 11:54:38 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: sorry for my ignorance
[5/1/2012 11:54:54 AM] Shawn Lee: yeah in case we go to war with the Indonesians/Malaysians
[5/1/2012 11:54:56 AM] Shawn Lee: heh
[5/1/2012 11:55:29 AM] Christina@info4disasters: do you have military draft Shawn?
[5/1/2012 11:55:48 AM] Shawn Lee: yup
[5/1/2012 11:56:07 AM] Christina@info4disasters: sucks
[5/1/2012 11:56:08 AM | Edited 11:56:19 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I've seen footage. The army is huge and so completey regimented
[5/1/2012 11:56:34 AM] Christina@info4disasters: we had draft in germany but they just changed it
[5/1/2012 11:56:36 AM] Shawn Lee: well I guess ultimately we don't have a choice
[5/1/2012 11:56:50 AM] Shawn Lee: small country with a citizens only numbering 3-4 million?
[5/1/2012 11:56:54 AM] Shawn Lee: or maybe 5 million
[5/1/2012 11:56:57 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: nope, I'm Chinese so I get the full blown military experienceyes, sucks bigtime
[5/1/2012 11:57:06 AM] Shawn Lee: another 1 million or so are foreign immigrants
[5/1/2012 11:57:10 AM] Shawn Lee: or expats
[5/1/2012 11:57:13 AM] Shawn Lee: who are just here for work
[5/1/2012 11:57:26 AM] Christina@info4disasters: where do your immigrants come from?
[5/1/2012 11:57:33 AM] Shawn Lee: so not many would sign up for a career in the military  not enough for a professional force
[5/1/2012 11:57:46 AM] Shawn Lee: so conscription is a given tbh, except 2 years seems a tad too long for me
[5/1/2012 11:57:50 AM] Shawn Lee: uhmm, everywhere really.
[5/1/2012 11:58:21 AM] Christina@info4disasters: 2 years? ours was 18 month
[5/1/2012 11:58:21 AM] Shawn Lee: lower wage workers from India/bangladesh/china
[5/1/2012 11:58:28 AM] Shawn Lee: thailand and malaysia too
[5/1/2012 11:58:31 AM] Christina@info4disasters: vietnam?
[5/1/2012 11:58:54 AM] Shawn Lee: haven't encountered the viets here..
[5/1/2012 11:59:00 AM] Shawn Lee: not that many, at least
[5/1/2012 11:59:02 AM] Christina@info4disasters: ok
[5/1/2012 11:59:03 AM] Shawn Lee: i'm sure there are some
[5/1/2012 11:59:06 AM] Shawn Lee: professional workers also from the same countries
[5/1/2012 11:59:14 AM] Shawn Lee: but add to that australians, japs
[5/1/2012 11:59:14 AM] Shawn Lee: and lots of europeans/americans too
[5/1/2012 11:59:17 AM] Shawn Lee: israelis
[5/1/2012 11:59:36 AM] Shawn Lee: arabs
[5/1/2012 11:59:56 AM] Shawn Lee: we're pretty international, kinda like NYC
[5/1/2012 12:00:03 PM] Shawn Lee: though maybe not that extreme but you get the rough idea!
[5/1/2012 12:00:23 PM] Michael: [7:58:27 PM] Shawn Lee: i'm sure there are some
[7:58:37 PM] Shawn Lee: professional workers also from the same countries
[7:58:49 PM] Shawn Lee: but add to that australians, japs
[7:58:53 PM] Shawn Lee: and lots of europeans/americans too
[7:58:58 PM] Shawn Lee: israelis
[7:59:16 PM] Shawn Lee: arabs
[7:59:37 PM] Shawn Lee: we're pretty international, kinda like NYC
[7:59:44 PM] Shawn Lee: though maybe not that extreme but you get the rough idea!
[HRT_SBTF]Lees
[5/1/2012 12:00:36 PM] Michael: i like that shawn
[5/1/2012 12:01:01 PM] Michael: the international bit of it all
[5/1/2012 12:01:22 PM] Shawn Lee: yup, it's quite nice. But it's putting a huge strain on infrastructure
[5/1/2012 12:01:36 PM] Shawn Lee: hasn't been keeping pace with the influx of foreign labour
[5/1/2012 12:01:37 PM] Christina@info4disasters: are you directly in Singapore?
[5/1/2012 12:02:00 PM] Shawn Lee: really, really short sighted  not usually like this. Government's been pretty successful on the whole but i think complacency is setting in
[5/1/2012 12:02:01 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I have to look at size and density. 8million in NYC.
[5/1/2012 12:02:04 PM] Shawn Lee: yup I'm a Singaporean
[5/1/2012 12:02:14 PM] Christina@info4disasters: how many in Singapore?
[5/1/2012 12:02:20 PM] Shawn Lee: lived here my whole life, though I'd consider myself well-travelled
[5/1/2012 12:02:21 PM] Shawn Lee: I think.
[5/1/2012 12:02:22 PM] Shawn Lee: heh.
[5/1/2012 12:02:24 PM] Christina@info4disasters: I know some people here who travel to Singapore a lot
[5/1/2012 12:02:29 PM] Shawn Lee: which at 18 is quite nice
[5/1/2012 12:02:35 PM] Christina@info4disasters: nice
[5/1/2012 12:02:38 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (clap)
[5/1/2012 12:03:10 PM] Shawn Lee: yeah we're trying to rival HK as Asia's financial capital so..
[5/1/2012 12:03:16 PM] Shawn Lee: we do get lots of business travel here
[5/1/2012 12:03:28 PM] Shawn Lee: believe Manchester United's launching an IPO here soon?
[5/1/2012 12:03:35 PM] Shawn Lee: and formula one too
[5/1/2012 12:03:40 PM] Michael: lol
[5/1/2012 12:03:46 PM] Christina@info4disasters: some should shift from HK to Singapore or? With HK being under chinese control again
[5/1/2012 12:04:09 PM] Shawn Lee: yeah but that also brings you closer to the Chinese market
[5/1/2012 12:04:17 PM] Shawn Lee: which absolutely cannot be ignored
[5/1/2012 12:04:20 PM] Christina@info4disasters: right
[5/1/2012 12:04:30 PM] Shawn Lee: and that's why people are choosing HK over Singapore at times
[5/1/2012 12:04:34 PM] Christina@info4disasters: that needs a lot more attention than it's getting right now
[5/1/2012 12:04:36 PM] Shawn Lee: though air quality's terrible there hahah
[5/1/2012 12:05:05 PM] Shawn Lee: well if any of you get the opportunity to fly here, do come. It's a fantastic place to be
[5/1/2012 12:05:07 PM] Christina@info4disasters: yup
[5/1/2012 12:06:26 PM] Michael: shawn teach me a basic greeting phrase from your local (singapore)dialect
[5/1/2012 12:06:39 PM] Shawn Lee: and if you're a high roller well... tax is pretty low for you guys
[5/1/2012 12:06:39 PM] Shawn Lee: :D
[5/1/2012 12:06:40 PM] Shawn Lee: oh, we speak English so I suppose it's just..
[5/1/2012 12:06:41 PM] Shawn Lee: hi?
[5/1/2012 12:06:46 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: what a great site (if accurate)

[5/1/2012 12:07:08 PM] Michael: cool
[5/1/2012 12:07:13 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: :D
[5/1/2012 12:07:16 PM] Shawn Lee: though mandarin is widely spoken too
[5/1/2012 12:07:36 PM] Michael: so anything from mandarin
[5/1/2012 12:07:42 PM] Shawn Lee: especially with the mainlanders (chinese) coming in as cheap labour
[5/1/2012 12:07:48 PM] Shawn Lee: ni hao
[5/1/2012 12:07:48 PM] Shawn Lee: as in
[5/1/2012 12:07:58 PM] Shawn Lee: knee (shorter 'ee' sound) how
[5/1/2012 12:08:07 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (wave) ni hao
[5/1/2012 12:08:09 PM] Michael: wow
[5/1/2012 12:08:14 PM] Michael: ni hao
[5/1/2012 12:08:26 PM] Shawn Lee: hmm not sure if those numbers work out well Donna
[5/1/2012 12:08:28 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: hellllloooo
[5/1/2012 12:08:43 PM] Shawn Lee: food's still relatively cheap
[5/1/2012 12:08:56 PM] Shawn Lee: but transport and housing costs are high
[5/1/2012 12:08:59 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: That was the question for sure
[5/1/2012 12:09:04 PM] Shawn Lee: is that in USD?
[5/1/2012 12:09:09 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 12:09:18 PM] Shawn Lee: olkswagen Golf 1.4 90 KW Trendline (Or Equivalent New Car)  92,843.81 $      19,685.75 $
[5/1/2012 12:09:23 PM] Shawn Lee: not sure it's that cheap now
[5/1/2012 12:09:23 PM] Shawn Lee: hahaha
[5/1/2012 12:09:31 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (of course....)
[5/1/2012 12:09:49 PM] Shawn Lee: and before you ask why cars are so expensive
[5/1/2012 12:10:02 PM] Shawn Lee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_Entitlement
[5/1/2012 12:10:06 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: why are cars so expensive?
[5/1/2012 12:10:20 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (tmi)
[5/1/2012 12:10:30 PM] Shawn Lee: it almost hit 100k SGD this month
[5/1/2012 12:10:34 PM] Shawn Lee: believe it was at 95k?
[5/1/2012 12:10:40 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: omei
[5/1/2012 12:10:50 PM] Shawn Lee: so basically before you even think of buying a car, you've got to get that COE
[5/1/2012 12:10:52 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: COE or
[5/1/2012 12:10:56 PM] Shawn Lee: so 95k + whatever the cost of the car is
[5/1/2012 12:11:01 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: wow
[5/1/2012 12:11:27 PM] Shawn Lee: (for comparison 95kSGD = 76879USD)
[5/1/2012 12:12:05 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: got it
[5/1/2012 12:12:13 PM] Shawn Lee: I believe that could get you a pretty swanky car stateside?
[5/1/2012 12:12:14 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I can't afford that
[5/1/2012 12:12:25 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Yes it could
[5/1/2012 12:12:36 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: pretty swanky
[5/1/2012 12:12:37 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: def
[5/1/2012 12:12:59 PM] Shawn Lee: and housing wise I think it's closing in on NYC too
[5/1/2012 12:13:02 PM] Shawn Lee: pretty expensive
[5/1/2012 12:14:41 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: so expensive in Manhattan
[5/1/2012 12:14:51 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: only rich and poor
[5/1/2012 12:15:20 PM] Shawn Lee: yep
[5/1/2012 12:15:27 PM] Shawn Lee: sad reality
[5/1/2012 12:15:55 PM] Shawn Lee: ah well
[5/1/2012 12:16:00 PM] Shawn Lee: pretty glad I'm born here though
[5/1/2012 12:16:13 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: my studio (I used to have in NY) 200 sq ft max
[5/1/2012 12:16:23 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: $2,000 now
[5/1/2012 12:16:29 PM] Shawn Lee: ah
[5/1/2012 12:16:34 PM] Shawn Lee: that's... insane
[5/1/2012 12:16:37 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: insane
[5/1/2012 12:16:46 PM] Shawn Lee: but that's in manhattan i suppose?
[5/1/2012 12:17:48 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 12:18:21 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: great downtown location in the West Village (Greenwich Village)
[5/1/2012 12:18:40 PM] Shawn Lee: well somewhere close to orchard road (that's the main shopping street) would cost about $9000 a month (at 1,496 sqft)
[5/1/2012 12:19:08 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: still mourning losing it to greedy landlords...it was rent-controlled $850/month when I lived there
[5/1/2012 12:19:14 PM] Shawn Lee: heh
[5/1/2012 12:19:29 PM] Shawn Lee: that's why it's better to buy than to rent!
[5/1/2012 12:19:49 PM] Shawn Lee: though that's pretty tough
[5/1/2012 12:20:02 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 12:20:33 PM] Shawn Lee: oh yes if any of you do pop by Singapore
[5/1/2012 12:20:35 PM] *** Litea has left ***
[5/1/2012 12:20:39 PM] Shawn Lee: give me a shout and I'd be glad to show you folks around!
[5/1/2012 12:20:54 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Where I live now...about an hour max outside NYC property taxes are anywhere from $7,000 to $10,000 a year
[5/1/2012 12:21:12 PM] Shawn Lee: not sure how much the property tax is here
[5/1/2012 12:21:22 PM] Shawn Lee: parents handle that
[5/1/2012 12:21:35 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: That's not standard for the US.
[5/1/2012 12:22:02 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: There's not even a real reason I know of why it's so high here
[5/1/2012 12:22:21 PM] Shawn Lee: well the demand is there
[5/1/2012 12:22:26 PM] Shawn Lee: and it's pretty inelastic
[5/1/2012 12:22:38 PM] Shawn Lee: so might as well increase tax rates so that the state can obtain more funding
[5/1/2012 12:23:30 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: when do you have to report, Shawn?
[5/1/2012 12:23:41 PM] Shawn Lee: getting enlisted on 9th of may
[5/1/2012 12:23:48 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: oh my!
[5/1/2012 12:23:56 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: crap
[5/1/2012 12:24:03 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: and then?
[5/1/2012 12:24:08 PM] Shawn Lee: why, would you be popping by then?
[5/1/2012 12:24:09 PM] Shawn Lee: hahah
[5/1/2012 12:24:14 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: no
[5/1/2012 12:24:20 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: wish I were
[5/1/2012 12:24:34 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: just that it's so soon
[5/1/2012 12:24:37 PM] Shawn Lee: ah, yes it is
[5/1/2012 12:24:39 PM] Shawn Lee: but well
[5/1/2012 12:24:43 PM] Shawn Lee: might as well go in and be done with it
[5/1/2012 12:24:49 PM] Shawn Lee: will have to serve those 2 years either way!
[5/1/2012 12:24:53 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: good attitude
[5/1/2012 12:25:00 PM] Shawn Lee: not really
[5/1/2012 12:25:13 PM] Shawn Lee: it's a serve and (excuse the swearing) f*ck off attitude
[5/1/2012 12:26:09 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: s'ok...don't blame you at all
[5/1/2012 12:26:26 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: of course, you know we don't curse in New York
[5/1/2012 12:26:39 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: no swearng allowed
[5/1/2012 12:26:41 PM] Shawn Lee: sarcasm?
[5/1/2012 12:26:42 PM] Shawn Lee: ;)
[5/1/2012 12:26:44 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (rofl)
[5/1/2012 12:26:50 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 12:27:17 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: oh my.
[5/1/2012 12:27:57 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: sarcasm is my preferred humor
[5/1/2012 12:28:10 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: it can be dangerous in IM though
[5/1/2012 12:28:19 PM] Shawn Lee: yeah
[5/1/2012 12:28:23 PM] Shawn Lee: hard to tell!
[5/1/2012 12:28:50 PM] Shawn Lee: hmm well since NYC's skyline is so well known here's some from downtown singapore
[5/1/2012 12:28:51 PM] Shawn Lee: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/26/march2012032.jpg/
[5/1/2012 12:29:13 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes, our skyline just changed a bit
[5/1/2012 12:29:19 PM] Shawn Lee: http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/3016/march2012044.jpg (P.S. that's an infinity pool on top the ark-like thing)
[5/1/2012 12:29:24 PM] Shawn Lee: yeah, one WTC?
[5/1/2012 12:29:32 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 12:29:44 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: you have a beautiful skyline
[5/1/2012 12:29:45 PM] Shawn Lee: look forward to visiting NYC again soon
[5/1/2012 12:29:59 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: how long ago were you here?
[5/1/2012 12:30:05 PM] Shawn Lee: '10
[5/1/2012 12:30:19 PM] Shawn Lee: pity I was only there for a couple of days
[5/1/2012 12:30:32 PM] Shawn Lee: had a student's conference there and in DC?
[5/1/2012 12:30:55 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: There's so much to see, 2 days is something though
[5/1/2012 12:31:16 PM] Shawn Lee: hopefully I'll get to visit next year
[5/1/2012 12:31:20 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Things have changed even since '10
[5/1/2012 12:31:22 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: brb
[5/1/2012 12:31:22 PM] Shawn Lee: or the following year once i'm discharged
[5/1/2012 12:31:30 PM] Shawn Lee: since my cousins are working there!
[5/1/2012 12:37:56 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: ah fresh (coffee)
[5/1/2012 12:38:20 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: your cousins work in NY or DC?
[5/1/2012 12:38:26 PM] Shawn Lee: NYC
[5/1/2012 12:38:47 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I love the infinity pool...so cool.
[5/1/2012 12:39:06 PM] Shawn Lee: wait till the end of the year
[5/1/2012 12:39:17 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: whereabouts in NY?
[5/1/2012 12:39:35 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: end of year?
[5/1/2012 12:39:50 PM] Shawn Lee: uhh, she'll be graduating from NYU soon and believe she starts with Citi in 2 months time
[5/1/2012 12:40:28 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: ah...so she's around Union Square...great part of the city
[5/1/2012 12:40:32 PM] Shawn Lee: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204781804577267344062549900.html
[5/1/2012 12:40:50 PM] Shawn Lee: in summary
[5/1/2012 12:40:51 PM] Shawn Lee: Singapore's latest mega-attraction, Gardens by the Bay, aims to be one of the biggest and most technologically advanced parks in the world, sure to rival New York's Central Park. WSJ's Shibani Mahtani gives Deborah Kan a tour of the green space.
[5/1/2012 12:42:28 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Wow. That is supercool!
[5/1/2012 12:43:20 PM] Shawn Lee: yep, opens in june I believe
[5/1/2012 12:43:27 PM] Shawn Lee: pity i'll be busy in the army
[5/1/2012 12:44:06 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: For all the ways I don't like Mayor Bloomberg, he was still a big improvement over Guilianni and has worked tirelessly at trying to get NY smoke-free and Green.
[5/1/2012 12:44:19 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: with alot of successes
[5/1/2012 12:44:33 PM] Shawn Lee: smoke free sounds good
[5/1/2012 12:44:53 PM] Shawn Lee: and green, well, isn't that what central park is for!
[5/1/2012 12:44:53 PM] Shawn Lee: ;)
[5/1/2012 12:45:07 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: hahaha
[5/1/2012 12:45:20 PM] Shawn Lee: not like you can plant trees on the side of the roads now
[5/1/2012 12:45:29 PM] Shawn Lee: that's what we've got but that was planned
[5/1/2012 12:45:37 PM] Shawn Lee: hard to do it otherwise
[5/1/2012 12:45:40 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: we lost a number of ancient oaks in Brooklyn & queens when a tornado came through
[5/1/2012 12:45:48 PM] Shawn Lee: no tornadoes here  phew!
[5/1/2012 12:45:53 PM] Shawn Lee: nor earthquakes
[5/1/2012 12:45:56 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: (whew)
[5/1/2012 12:46:10 PM] Shawn Lee: the brits got lucky when they found this place
[5/1/2012 12:46:32 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: tornadoes & eq's aren't common here, but last year was an exception
[5/1/2012 12:46:36 PM] Shawn Lee: no earthquakes, no typhoons/hurricanes, no tsunamis
[5/1/2012 12:46:47 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: hurricanes and micro-ursts
[5/1/2012 12:46:59 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: microbursts
[5/1/2012 12:47:07 PM] Shawn Lee: yeah we do get squalls once in a while
[5/1/2012 12:47:18 PM] Shawn Lee: being a tropical country
[5/1/2012 12:47:26 PM] Shawn Lee: not sure if that equates to a microburst though
[5/1/2012 12:47:56 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: There in Prospect Park in Brooklyn as well...in terms of large parks...it was designed by the same man
[5/1/2012 12:48:28 PM] Shawn Lee: it's nice
[5/1/2012 12:48:31 PM] Shawn Lee: having such large parks
[5/1/2012 12:48:38 PM] Shawn Lee: pity we can't have that here
[5/1/2012 12:48:53 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: some prefer it's design, but it never receives the recognition in comparrson though.
[5/1/2012 12:49:21 PM] Shawn Lee: hyde park is nice too!
[5/1/2012 12:49:24 PM] Shawn Lee: in london
[5/1/2012 12:49:49 PM] Shawn Lee: though I was freezing when I went there
[5/1/2012 12:49:56 PM] Shawn Lee: that's what you get for not being properly attired in winter =/
[5/1/2012 12:50:10 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: The National Parks system here is def a pride and joy that we've had to really work to protect these last several years
[5/1/2012 12:50:19 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I've never been to London
[5/1/2012 12:50:23 PM] Shawn Lee: i figure it's been a victim of budget cuts
[5/1/2012 12:50:24 PM] Shawn Lee: ?
[5/1/2012 12:51:06 PM] Shawn Lee: ahh, London's brilliant  weather's a bummer though
[5/1/2012 12:51:07 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Yes, in terms of protected environs, but also in an effort for more and more building...greed
[5/1/2012 12:51:18 PM] Shawn Lee: definitely a place worth visiting, especially when it's just across the pond ;)
[5/1/2012 12:51:30 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: indeed
[5/1/2012 12:51:34 PM] Shawn Lee: guess it's ultimately a compromise
[5/1/2012 12:51:49 PM] Shawn Lee: space is hard to come by, parks seem like an easy way to free up land
[5/1/2012 12:52:01 PM] Shawn Lee: though I hardly see the need for NYC to do that
[5/1/2012 12:52:05 PM] Shawn Lee: it's a large place
[5/1/2012 12:52:15 PM] Shawn Lee: and they've got the entire state to expand into
[5/1/2012 12:52:39 PM] Shawn Lee: unlike us in Singapore  an entire country surviving on that same gross area
[5/1/2012 12:52:41 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: no, not in Central Park...I just started free associating across the board
[5/1/2012 12:53:01 PM] Shawn Lee: ah
[5/1/2012 12:53:03 PM] Shawn Lee: right
[5/1/2012 12:53:06 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: This is my favorite park in the country although I haven't seen all.
[5/1/2012 12:53:08 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm
[5/1/2012 12:53:12 PM] Shawn Lee: yosemite?
[5/1/2012 12:53:13 PM] Shawn Lee: ah
[5/1/2012 12:53:14 PM] Shawn Lee: yes
[5/1/2012 12:53:16 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes
[5/1/2012 12:53:27 PM] Shawn Lee: neither have I, but it looks really, really nice. Would love to go there some time
[5/1/2012 12:53:40 PM] Shawn Lee: along with the falls
[5/1/2012 12:54:02 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I lived in SF for 10 years and had the fortune of visiting often...so close.
[5/1/2012 12:54:18 PM] Shawn Lee: on yosemite: http://vimeo.com/40802206
[5/1/2012 12:54:31 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: The falls come in the springtime, so timing is everything
[5/1/2012 12:54:38 PM] Shawn Lee: SFO seems like a nice place
[5/1/2012 12:54:44 PM] Shawn Lee: haven't been to the west coast
[5/1/2012 12:56:11 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: It is. That's a great video.  The West Coast, northern...spectacular... I love NY, but...
[5/1/2012 12:56:45 PM] Shawn Lee: I'm a city person at heart so..
[5/1/2012 12:56:46 PM] Shawn Lee: heh
[5/1/2012 12:58:55 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Well...the difference is that there is just no place like NY (she says with pride), in terms of culture and even in terms of free "culture"/events.
[5/1/2012 12:59:08 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: But San Francisco is a great city indeed.
[5/1/2012 12:59:21 PM] Shawn Lee: definitely
[5/1/2012 12:59:31 PM] Shawn Lee: (NY)
[5/1/2012 12:59:57 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: One thing I love is it's proxcimity to beautiful locations.
[5/1/2012 1:00:19 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: 1 hour in any direction and you are in a wonderful natural environ
[5/1/2012 1:00:32 PM] Shawn Lee: which, SFO or NY?
[5/1/2012 1:00:47 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: SF
[5/1/2012 1:00:52 PM] Shawn Lee: ah
[5/1/2012 1:01:04 PM] Shawn Lee: well I guess I've been pampered over here
[5/1/2012 1:01:07 PM] Shawn Lee: 1 hour seems like a loooong time!
[5/1/2012 1:01:17 PM] Shawn Lee: (this is what happens when you live in a city state)
[5/1/2012 1:01:22 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: NY has beauty aroung it too..close...in-state...but not as grand
[5/1/2012 1:01:40 PM] Shawn Lee: where is yellowstone by the way?
[5/1/2012 1:02:10 PM] *** conradpn1 has left ***
[5/1/2012 1:02:35 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Montana I believe...middle of the country and I admit I have never been.
[5/1/2012 1:03:18 PM] om SBTF: very nice in parts.. and just between Montana and Idaho is some truly lovely wilderness (the very last of it, actually) such a shame
[5/1/2012 1:04:23 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: yes.  I understand Montana is quite breathtaking.
[5/1/2012 1:05:00 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: And Maine on this coast.  Isn't it still considered wilderness...parts.

[5/3/2012 12:41:08 PM] Sara Farmer: Mikel Maron is talking well about communities.
[5/3/2012 12:42:20 PM] Sara Farmer: I'm watching people talking about our work, and I'm feeling excluded by them.  This is both sad and ironic.
[5/3/2012 12:43:39 PM] Sara Farmer: It's like we're all talking about sharing, but we're also separate communities doing the same thing in different places.
[5/3/2012 12:43:44 PM] Sara Farmer: *sad*
[5/3/2012 1:28:38 PM] alexcomninos5: Is anyone recording this? I am behind a slooooooow connection :(
[5/3/2012 1:39:07 PM] om SBTF: that's how I feel every time I see calls for top down analytics to discover info about people who have mobile phones in their pocket.
[5/3/2012 2:27:16 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: so disparaging
[5/3/2012 8:54:32 PM] Sara Farmer: Who disparaging?

[5/3/2012 9:43:11 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Hi Sara
[5/3/2012 9:44:26 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: I meant that in response to the conversation about the @GFDRR and #IAForum webcast.
[5/3/2012 9:56:13 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: It's like your work and history are not being acknowledged.
[5/4/2012 8:54:31 AM] Sara Farmer: Ah. Gotcha. I'm mid-post to crisismappers about that at the moment.
[5/4/2012 10:51:41 AM] Sara Farmer: Hokay. In response to the recent "how do we know what's going on" thread, I've done some reorganising on the SBTF Ning homepage.  The Getting Started Guide now has its own separate page (and is a good place to go if you're feeling a bit rusty too).  I've moved some of the other boxes around so you see things that change often, like events and the recent updates to the Ning site and Forum. I've removed the list of teams because you already have that on the menu bar, but I've left the pictures of members because, well, it's pretty.  I'll try to add information that's outside the Ning later (e.g. the frequently asked questions list), unless there's a good reason for keeping it outside (e.g. visibility to other groups).
[5/4/2012 10:58:06 AM] Steven Longmire: Sara, is there anything you are not doing?  (F)
[5/4/2012 10:58:14 AM] Steven Longmire: incredible

[5/10/2012 5:17:33 AM] Tausif: Do we have a deployment for syria crisis?
[5/10/2012 8:40:27 AM] Heather Leson: go sara!
[5/10/2012 9:12:06 AM] Melissa Elliott: No Tausif, we don't. I believe there was one under consideration, but there were security concerns
[5/10/2012 5:14:07 PM] Tausif: :( but Syria is getting into deep crisis
[5/10/2012 5:14:34 PM] Tausif: there is less water in river than weapons in streets :(
[5/10/2012 5:19:06 PM] Robbie MacKay: @Tausif do you know about https://syriatracker.crowdmap.com/ ? and https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/ ?
[5/10/2012 5:20:39 PM] Tausif: thanks Robbie, for the links
[5/10/2012 5:21:01 PM] Tausif: I was not aware of these
[5/10/2012 5:21:13 PM] robbie.mackay: Given the nature of SBTF volunteers, we're very limited in terms of high security risk deployments. We have no way to verify volunteers are who they say they are.
[5/10/2012 5:23:49 PM] Tausif: I understand!
[5/10/2012 5:29:15 PM] robbie.mackay: That said - local groups do amazing things with and without SBTF help. And in high security environments - much better to have people on the ground
[5/10/2012 9:43:50 PM] Steven Longmire: Robbie, for side discussion within the next 90 day's, make a mental note on "PeerVetting" it is a works in progress from a lot of smart people and a vein of Risk vs. Threat components.  In the US, the Volunteer Vetting is a little different as (not the crap ones you find on the internet) Background Checks and Sexual Predator Registry Check. Just about 2 weeks away on that one.  Due to its nature, that is about all I can say in a chat window, but on the international front magic is in play. Thank you for bringing that up!!!!  I look forward to a sync sometime in the future.
[5/11/2012 12:18:43 AM] Steven Longmire: If you have contacts in other countries would be awesome, I am trying to bring as much of this as possible open source, just need some sige offs before that will happen, respectfully.

Fortunately, Brenda from those offices knows Andrej and also has read - http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/01/09/the-unexpected-impact-of-the-libya-crisis-map-and-the-standby-volunteer-task-force/

[5/29/2012 2:32:39 AM] Jeannine Lemaire: Earthquake in North Italy. My whole room was shaking... thought I was going crazy for a bit, strongest earthquake Milan has felt since the last 50 years or so
[5/29/2012 3:02:54 AM] Jeannine Lemaire: MILAN  A 5.8-magnitude earthquake has shaken much of northern Italy, causing some buildings to collapse in areas hit by a larger quake on May 20. No injuries were reported immediately.

The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck around 9:00 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) and was centered 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Bologna. It caused tents housing evacuees from the previous quake to shake.

Schools and stores throughout the area were evacuated as a precaution.

[6/12/2012 7:44:11 PM] Kirk Morris: Think the Volunteer Technical Community and SBTF have not made a difference? Then ponder this:

Dr. Rajiv Shah, Administrator of USAID, is quoted this week:

All of these developments have made me think about how crucial it is to expand the community of individuals and organizations that we listen to and work with. This past week, our GeoCenter and the Development Credit Authority hosted our Agencys first-ever crowdsourcing event, enlisting 150 volunteers to clean up and geotag thousands of loan data records. That event not only increased our Agencys transparency, it created a model for the entire governmentour event was the first time data.gov was opened to crowdsourcing. It wont be the last.

[6/20/2012 8:39:01 PM] Sara Farmer: @Robbie - thank you, but they don't do what I need: I'm looking very specifically for the UN countrynames only, and ISO3166 doesn't include region names. I've already checked all the data.un.gov indices against ISO3166 (pycountry is good for this) - I now need to go tighter and prove that the countrynames in there don't match their own codes either.  If you see any countrycode lists with start and end validity dates in them, that would be very much appreciated though...
[6/20/2012 8:43:37 PM] robbie.mackay: ah I see.. so ISO3166 doesn't have regions? Is the UN list still giving ISO codes for regions though?
[6/20/2012 8:47:55 PM] robbie.mackay: the wikipedia ISO_3166-3 page gives validity years for old ISO codes (not current ones though)
Looks like some serious scraping required to find all the changes to ISO codes over time :(
[6/20/2012 8:48:42 PM | Edited 8:49:59 PM] robbie.mackay: there's something depressing about the ISO codes coming in an access database, but not in a simple CSV.. (or some open format)
[6/21/2012 5:26:19 AM] Sara Farmer: They're in pycountry - all wrapped up and ready to use in Python.  And no, the region names aren't in the ISO standards - but I did find them on the data.un.org website.  And have remembered how to scrape html using lxml...
[6/21/2012 5:26:46 AM] Sara Farmer: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm is the place.
[6/21/2012 5:58:11 AM] Kirk Morris: man, this conversation has me lost
[6/21/2012 6:02:00 AM] HR Jus Mackinnon: Welcome to my world Kirk ;)
[6/21/2012 6:02:42 AM] Kirk Morris: whoa, i'll stay on my side of the street :)

[6/21/2012 1:51:26 PM] Sara Farmer: at home - am in sensemakers symposium in NYC right now.
[6/21/2012 9:02:34 PM] Melissa Elliott: Hi all. An acquaintance is asking: "Has anyone developed a site wherein a industry and community have collaborated in developing and using Ushahidi as a media to spot and squish, or find and fix, specific harms?  Let me explain.  There are a number of industries that are notorious for environmental violations.  For example, an oil executive once told me that it is impossible for a refinery to be in total compliance. In my experience, the same can be said of any of the following:  metal recycling, vessel water pollution, plastic bags, styrofoam take out containers, etc.  Environmental violations are inevitable given poor processes and practices.
Given the above, has anyone developed a site wherein community volunteers spot specific practices and/or violations that provides violators with alerts?  The violators act on the alerts by reporting back to the site (lets say w/in 48 hours)  with one of three responses:  fixed, no violation found or violation continues.  Findings  could be easily verified and victories easily tracked."
[6/21/2012 9:02:40 PM] Melissa Elliott: anyone know of any?
[6/21/2012 9:13:20 PM] Christina@info4disasters: (wave)
[6/21/2012 9:20:21 PM] robbie.mackay: not something I've seen - but that would be very cool
[6/21/2012 10:38:44 PM] blueiz: @Melissa - i don't think this is exactly what  you're after but it is kinda on a similiar track : http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/
[6/22/2012 1:16:01 AM] Heather Leson: HI Melissa, there was one similar example in the Phillipines. There are a few environmental maps out there with techniques which might be of use.
[6/22/2012 5:21:23 AM] jeroen_itc: we've been exploring such "blame and shame" reporting systems. biggest difficulty is generating momentum (data flow) as in motivating or finding incentives for VGI to be submitted. I also expect there is a need for transparency and trust/verification before big-bucks companies start adhering to "wildly tweeted allegations". Anyway, regarding functionality of public services (not an oil spill I know)it does not really seem to work. (check http://geonetwork.itc.nl/zanzibar and http://blog.daraja.org/2012/02/why-did-maji-matone-fail-3-citizens.html)
[6/22/2012 6:38:56 AM] Melissa Elliott: Thanks so much!!!
[6/22/2012 10:46:06 AM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: Good Day to all! Hope my US friends are staying cool.. at least here in the south we have central AC, most of us anyway. Enjoy your weekend! (party)
[6/22/2012 10:46:12 AM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: (hug)
[6/22/2012 10:53:10 AM] Sara Farmer: open311 and related systems are probably the best example of citzen reporting and public-body fixing. Examples include openny.com, FixMyStreet.co.uk, opentransport.co.uk - others via open311.org.  Phil Ashlock (NYC) and Louise Crowe (UK) are good people to talk to about this.
[6/22/2012 10:54:01 AM] Sara Farmer: http://www.nyc.gov/apps/311srmap/ is quite fun... I had no idea we had so many problems with pigeon droppings...
[6/22/2012 11:37:30 AM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: LOL>>> pigeon droppings.. amazing! Awesome links, as always @Sara.. Thank you!! (highfive)

[6/28/2012 4:33:38 PM] Kirk Morris: here's something to be proud of: ?#USAIDcrowd? Crowdsourcing resulted in high quality output - 89% accuracy vs 66% accuracy for automated method.
[6/28/2012 5:00:59 PM] Virginia Brussa: (y) great @Kirk
[6/29/2012 12:58:32 AM] Heather Leson: I am on course at Oxford University. Some of you worked on the pakreport.org project (pre-SBTF). There is a young lady here who made me cry as she talked about the importance of this movement. She will record a video with me today so that some of you can cry too.
[6/29/2012 12:59:29 AM] Heather Leson: I am speaking at Google Big Tent on monday next. It is primarily about general crisis verification, however, I will be mentioning all of your great work to move that ball forward. Meeting with the sinsai.info folks too. I hope to connect some of them back to you
[6/29/2012 6:10:08 AM] Kirk Morris: don't forget to recover as well. :)
[6/29/2012 6:17:30 AM] rodrigodavies: hi heather - that big tent event sounds great. do you know how i might be able to get an invitation?
[6/29/2012 6:35:55 AM] Kirk Morris: hey rodrigo
[6/29/2012 7:14:38 AM] Sara Farmer: Oooh - who's the young lady?  We had two exceptional female leads (at Cambridge and London) during Pakistan 2010 floods - was it one of them?
[6/29/2012 7:16:02 AM] Sawsan Gad: I don't think she's the lady from Cambridge, she's now my current boss at the WB in DC, her name is Keiko Saito :)
[6/29/2012 7:16:26 AM] Sara Farmer: Keiko?
[6/29/2012 7:16:44 AM] Sawsan Gad: yeah
[6/29/2012 7:16:53 AM] Sawsan Gad: oh I'm sorry, you're referring to another lead, not necessarily that from the Bank.
[6/29/2012 7:17:12 AM] Kirk Morris: i think maybe Sana Saleem?
[6/29/2012 7:17:20 AM] Sara Farmer: Wave hi to her - she was at the Cambridge camp too, if my memory serves me right...
[6/29/2012 7:17:42 AM] Sawsan Gad: I'll sure tell her! :)
[6/29/2012 7:22:00 AM] Sara Farmer: The ladies I'm talking about are Bisha Ali (London camp) and Salma Patel (Cambridge) - fiercely bright, and determined to do everything they could to help Pakistan.
[6/29/2012 7:22:20 AM] Sawsan Gad: ah! sweet!
[6/29/2012 7:22:55 AM] Kirk Morris: Sana and Heather are sharing the same classes, program... tis why I suspect
[6/29/2012 7:24:05 AM] Kirk Morris: man, last day of work and then 10 days off

[6/29/2012 7:24:58 AM] Sara Farmer: ...problem with working for yourself is that you're still working for an idiot, but you look stupid when you tell everyone that.
[6/29/2012 7:25:25 AM] Kirk Morris: i worked for myself for 35 years
[6/29/2012 7:25:41 AM] Kirk Morris: then i endentured myself

[6/29/2012 8:53:43 AM] Kirk Morris: Bingo!
[6/29/2012 8:54:15 AM] Kirk Morris: that's why i felt like an idiot for 35 years?
[6/29/2012 8:56:42 AM] Sara Farmer: Bosses are always idiots - you knew that, right?
[6/29/2012 8:57:13 AM] Sara Farmer: (it's their job - or at least part of their job - to take the blame and share the credit...)
[6/29/2012 11:44:04 AM] Melissa Elliott: Wow:  http://www.businessinsider.com/morsi-says-jihad-is-our-path-and-death-in-the-name-of-allah-is-our-goal-2012-6#ixzz1zCKxC2kR

[6/29/2012 11:57:00 AM] Kirk Morris: 
well his speech in Tahir just now was far more moderate and widely accepted
[6/29/2012 11:58:06 AM] Kirk Morris: but, he may well appal the West. He was elected by the Egyptians
[6/29/2012 12:01:35 PM] Sawsan Gad: Oh no, please, no no no! please!!!!!!! :'(  I am about to get a panic attack right now.
[6/29/2012 12:02:15 PM] Kirk Morris: ohhhhhhhhhhhh?
[6/29/2012 12:02:29 PM] Kirk Morris: i have cold compresses?
[6/29/2012 12:03:08 PM] Sawsan Gad: I'm not gonna start a discussion about this, but please don't make it look like he represents Egyptian votes. You know he won with a fraction percent in an election that was designed to end up in such a apocalyptic catch.
[6/29/2012 12:03:23 PM] Sawsan Gad: lol thanks
[6/29/2012 12:03:33 PM] Sawsan Gad: have them around, I';ll need them.
[6/29/2012 12:04:11 PM] Kirk Morris: i'm simply saying we the West should keep our noises out letting things settle.
[6/29/2012 12:05:02 PM] Sawsan Gad: oh ok :D (I meant he was about to give me a heart attack with that statement, not you. They were two separate comments) :)
[6/29/2012 12:05:41 PM] Sawsan Gad: I'm not even watching the speech to save the remnants of my sanity.
[6/29/2012 12:05:48 PM] Kirk Morris: heart attacks are so easy to come by these days :)
[6/29/2012 12:06:17 PM] Sawsan Gad: true... *sigh*
[6/29/2012 12:06:53 PM] Kirk Morris: @abuaardvark: Morsi's audience was Salafis and Gamaa who have made Omar Abd el-Rahman a touchstone issue -- dumb thing to say, but that's why he did it.
[6/29/2012 12:07:51 PM] Kirk Morris: oh boy... now AP has it
[6/29/2012 12:08:36 PM] Sawsan Gad: Sweet. So now we have to appeal to Gamaa'Islamiya and Omar Abd el-Rahman audience................... *bangs head against the wall*
[6/29/2012 12:08:50 PM] Kirk Morris: lol
[6/29/2012 12:08:54 PM] Kirk Morris: so sorry man

[7/5/2012 10:16:32 PM] Melissa Elliott: yikes. concerning.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/cambodia-mystery-disease-_n_1650920.html?ir=World&ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
[7/5/2012 10:16:44 PM] Melissa Elliott: -- A World Health Organization expert says it's too early to know whether a mixture of known diseases or something new is responsible for the deaths of more than 60 children in Cambodia.

The mystery disease has killed 61 of the 62 children hospitalized since April, but there's no indication it is spreading from person to person. Patients suffer a high fever, followed by severe respiratory problems that progress quickly. Some also experience neurological symptoms.

Dr. Nima Asgari of the WHO in Phnom Penh said Thursday that health workers are combing through victims' records to try to determine whether the problem is a combination of known ailments or a new disease.

Most patients reported were under 7 years old and were spread across several provinces in southern and central Cambodia.

[7/12/2012 1:31:33 AM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Thank goodness you are here with us. I can't imagine.
[7/12/2012 7:21:28 AM] Sara Farmer: I had military friends who were otherwise shockproof, but this one got to them - having to watch people being killed and not being allowed to do anything about it.
[7/12/2012 7:23:03 AM] Sara Farmer: It worries me that Golden Dawn are starting to be very visible again.  Feels like watching the Nazi party rising.
[7/12/2012 10:51:04 AM] Christina@info4disasters: that's how it feels to me too
[7/12/2012 10:52:28 AM] Christina@info4disasters: and memories of Srebrenica and Sarajevo are so haunting
[7/12/2012 10:54:20 AM] Christina@info4disasters: we need to be watching these new right wing formations

[7/12/2012 1:12:15 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: how are you and everyone here?
[7/12/2012 1:12:28 PM] Sara Farmer: I believe the last 11 years were some of the hottest since records began.  Am going to need more suntan lotion...
[7/12/2012 1:13:34 PM] Sara Farmer: @Leesa - I'm just running an app for RobertC - I stripped the urls out of the Haiti January 2011 3W list, and am looking for all the pages on those sites that mention Haiti.  Are quite a few of them...
[7/12/2012 1:14:13 PM] Sara Farmer: Yep... is going to take a while. And Emily the cak has kidnapped my "left of w" key again.

Feels like watching the Nazi party risingwho is Golden Dawn and are they located in Bosnia? I am not real familiar with the names/places.. Stina, aka Christina has spoken of it a few times.
[7/12/2012 1:16:08 PM] Hilary Nicole: @leesa well from new orleans but current on fellowship in Morocco

[7/12/2012 1:16:38 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: Hilary, how in the world could I forget your NOLA connection...
[7/12/2012 1:16:45 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: how is Morocco?
[7/12/2012 1:17:24 PM] Sara Farmer: Golden Dawn are Greek - they've been rising in Greek politics of late; have seats in parliament now etc. They're thugs. They were also involved in/ were the Greek mercenaries who worked with the Serbs in their ethnic cleansing.
[7/12/2012 1:17:33 PM] Hilary Nicole: i cant complain about ending the work day by jumping in the ocean to be sure. it is easy to forget i go silent for months then pop up with a flurry of activity and then rebury my head in the sand
[7/12/2012 1:17:35 PM] Hilary Nicole: :)
[7/12/2012 1:18:33 PM] Hilary Nicole: in general there is a growth of such groups across europe right now that are terrifying and targeting violence at immigrants more zealously lately
[7/12/2012 1:18:49 PM] Hilary Nicole: i think the tea party could head that way if we dont watch out
[7/12/2012 1:19:06 PM] Sara Farmer: @Hilary - yes. So far, it's been patchy, but it's very very messy. Not sure the Tea Party has the will or the organisation to get that far though.
[7/12/2012 1:19:25 PM] Hilary Nicole: indeed the Klan was encouraged by Obama's election simply because they believed it would swell their ranks by galvinizing the white population to action
[7/12/2012 1:19:45 PM] Hilary Nicole: i remember reading an interview with their leader not long ago which had my jaw dropped for days
[7/12/2012 1:19:52 PM] Hilary Nicole: lol
[7/12/2012 1:19:59 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: i go silent for months then pop up with a flurry of activity and then rebury my head in the sandI just go silent for days... but I do understand that line.
[7/12/2012 1:20:06 PM] Sara Farmer: OOkay Leesa - it seems we have more than one computing cat in our midst. Please tell me that you're really a human?
[7/12/2012 1:20:12 PM] Hilary Nicole: yes i know, i just cant help finding an excuse to bash the baggers any time i can
[7/12/2012 1:20:13 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: @Sara.. thank you for clarifying that.. great job

[7/12/2012 1:22:44 PM] Sara Farmer: Meanwhile, I did a test run of my website search code using my own name... the first page that came up was called "The Perfect Woman".  I think my algorithms might be broken...
[7/12/2012 1:22:59 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: @Sara.. your kitty and Donnas should meet.
[7/12/2012 1:23:11 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: the first page that came up was called "The Perfect Woman" (clap)

[7/12/2012 1:25:47 PM] Leesa[SBTF-MM&HRT] Info4Disasters: may I have link?
[7/12/2012 1:33:24 PM] Hilary Nicole: @sara that is genius
[7/12/2012 1:33:35 PM] Hilary Nicole: @leesa for now until october but hoping to extend it
[7/12/2012 1:33:57 PM] Hilary Nicole: somehow of all the languages ive battled to learn over the years the one ive been most afraid of (arabic) is coming easiest
[7/12/2012 1:34:12 PM] Hilary Nicole: ill be back to nola but only to defend my dissertation and run away again

[7/12/2012 1:36:01 PM] Hilary Nicole: i am working with the ministry of health
[7/12/2012 1:36:17 PM] Hilary Nicole: doing grunt work in exachnge for access to their data for my dissertation
[7/12/2012 1:36:35 PM | Removed 1:43:23 PM] Hilary Nicole: This message has been removed.
[7/12/2012 1:36:51 PM] Hilary Nicole: but at least ive gotten effective at the smile and nod
[7/12/2012 1:37:03 PM] Hilary Nicole: while i (headbang) on skype all day ;)
[7/12/2012 1:37:55 PM] Hilary Nicole: but i am grateful as it removes the single largest cost i face which i cant afford
[7/12/2012 1:38:09 PM] Hilary Nicole: so in the end i cant really compain at all, only in fun
[7/12/2012 1:42:48 PM] Sara Farmer: @Leesa - am working on creating a toolkit with RHOK... will eventually populate icanhazdatascience.com once I get all these bits of codes in nongeek-usable form (i.e. so you don't have to understand Python code to run them).
[7/12/2012 1:43:58 PM] Sara Farmer: (there's nothing on that site right now - most of my stuff is on my local machine, in github or opencrisis.net for the moment. I am *so* untidy, is going to take a while to make it all usable).
[7/12/2012 1:45:02 PM] Sara Farmer: (And yes, I do have a site dedicated to teaching my cat data science - icanhazdatascience.blogspot.com - just for the fun of it... and the excuse to post cat-with-keyboard pictures all over the place)
[7/12/2012 1:47:38 PM] Sara Farmer: Oooh... Hilary... you have *data*?
[7/12/2012 1:47:40 PM] Sara Farmer: Coo...

[7/19/2012 9:57:31 AM] Melissa Elliott: it's a proud moment for us for sure.
[7/19/2012 9:58:08 AM] *** Carmen Andrea Beltran has left ***

[7/19/2012 10:08:34 AM] Ellen Kay Endriss: @Patrick, your last slide today makes me wonder whether you know of/have connected with Jennifer Pahlka at Code for America. She has fabulous possum story that you should hear... http://blog.ted.com/2012/02/29/possum-problems-and-building-better-government-jennifer-pahlka-at-ted2012/

[7/19/2012 10:19:04 AM] Melissa Elliott: Great job Patrick!
[7/19/2012 10:19:41 AM] Melissa Elliott: (I think P has just turned skype back on  - looks like a delayed msg)
[7/19/2012 10:20:44 AM] Ellen Kay Endriss: @Patrick You did a great job speaking today!
[7/19/2012 10:21:11 AM] matteo.beltramin: I agree
[7/19/2012 10:21:23 AM] Patrick Meier: Thanks All! Couldn't do it without everyone on this team! :)
[7/19/2012 10:21:59 AM] Patrick Meier: I was in touch with Jennifer from Code for America last year, but not recently. Thanks for the ping, @Ellen
[7/19/2012 10:22:04 AM] Ellen Kay Endriss: @Matteo, thanks for sharing link to your thesis.
[7/19/2012 10:22:22 AM] matteo.beltramin: you are welcome

[7/19/2012 1:04:16 PM] (RE) Eliana Zemmer: @Matteo: really interesting thesis. Thanks for sharing it with us.
[7/19/2012 1:43:22 PM] Sara Farmer: @Matteo: is it in Mendeley?
[7/19/2012 1:53:09 PM] gracious1984: Hello
[7/19/2012 1:59:27 PM] Christina@info4disasters: so sorry I missed this today, i'm sure Patrick was wonderful as always
[7/19/2012 2:01:17 PM] Sara Farmer: He was - but so too were Hans Rosling and the head of UNOCHA.  Today was a bigger moment in our history than we possibly yet realise.
[7/19/2012 2:08:39 PM] Patrick Meier: Hans is amazing and so is Valerie, as well as the Kenyan rep. truly one of the best panels i've ever been on. just wow. video should be available for viewing in a few days. but again, there's no way i could have been on that panel were it not for the amazing work we've done here at the SBTF. it is a testament that we're not the talk talk talk types but the do-and-learn types. we get things done. it's often messy and difficult, but we act, do things and learn. GO TEAM!!!
[7/19/2012 2:09:29 PM] Kirk Morris: kenya seems to have led with open data

[7/31/2012 1:24:57 PM] Heather Leson: I think if the reports get filed, once he is online, he can add more admin and get them on the map
[7/31/2012 1:25:49 PM] Heather Leson: this brings up the reality. for onhaul projects like his, I should recommend to deployers that they consider adding an admin from a non-risk area. kind of mapper partners for emergencies.

[8/3/2012 9:12:25 AM] Melissa Elliott: Mapsters unite!  http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680285/crazy-maps-show-the-world-organized-by-human-activity#0
[8/3/2012 4:59:18 PM] Melissa Elliott: More on Maps:  this time is the Apple vs Google feud, front and center:  "Apple isn't just declaring its independence from Google Maps with its new in-house backend for Maps in iOS 6. It has developed a superior way to deliver map data that relies on resolution independent vectors rather than Google's multiple zoom levels of bit mapped images. "

[8/4/2012 1:42:30 AM] Sara Farmer: Erm yes. Looks like it's going to be a long - and creative - fight.
[8/7/2012 10:23:57 AM] Kirk Morris: Hilary... to where do we point interested parties? Where is the inofo posted?
[8/7/2012 11:44:33 AM] Hilary Nicole: FYI may be of interest
[8/7/2012 11:44:33 AM] Hilary Nicole: Dear all,

I have opened up a few more internships at the Information Services Section
(ISS) in OCHA Geneva.  The advertisements are open until mid-September. I have not put a specific period for the internship as I am happy to receive applications for people who are available at different times throughout the next year.

In specific regards to the *V&TC and Digital HumanitarianNetwork, *this would be helping to carry and build upon the important work that Luis and Natalie are currently doing such as *Guidance for Collaborating with V&TCs<https://www.box.com/s/4a35c2f66e7de9cd425e>
*, the Decision Makers Needs Community of Interest, facilitating (and
aiding) in the first DH Network activation, etc.

[8/7/2012 1:00:51 PM] Hilary Nicole: hope that help kirk: i you want i can forward original email
[8/7/2012 1:07:03 PM] Kirk Morris: no, got it thanks :)
[8/7/2012 1:14:06 PM] Sara Farmer: Can thoroughly recommend working with Andrej, CJ et al at ISS Geneva - they really know what they're doing, and they're trying to do some important work across this space.
[8/7/2012 2:11:59 PM] Kirk Morris: ooopppsss.. I didn't read "unpaid' :(
[8/7/2012 2:19:37 PM] Sara Farmer: It's a sad fact at the moment that getting funding for work that underpins *all* deployments is still very difficult.  The guys need any help they can get - am wondering if they'd consider people working remotely?
[8/7/2012 2:20:34 PM] Heather Leson: I want to find a way to fix that someday.
[8/7/2012 2:21:23 PM] Sara Farmer: We all do.  Unfortunately, the road to fixing it is to do it, and say "look how useful this is" to the funders.
[8/7/2012 2:21:29 PM] Heather Leson: yeah
[8/7/2012 2:22:10 PM] Heather Leson: socialcoding4good is doing some work around this topic (helping Frontline, Wikipedia and ushahidi)
[8/7/2012 2:23:14 PM] Sara Farmer: Yes... and in time there should be more, but as usual we're all making it up as we go along.  Pioneers again.
[8/7/2012 2:27:10 PM] Heather Leson: well, the SBTF is at the front of that train : )
[8/7/2012 2:28:10 PM] Sara Farmer: One of many groups pushing the field forward, but definitely given to pushing it harder and further whenever it can :)
[8/7/2012 3:23:50 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: (bandit) (wave)
[8/8/2012 5:12:53 AM] nataliec755: @all - I've been interning with Andrej this summer in the V&TC and Digital Humanitarian Network position (I am the "Natalie" mentioned in the posting :) ).  I highly encourage anyone who's interested to apply, and I am very happy to answer questions about my  experiences and the work that we've done.  Feel free to ping me via skype or email (natalie.chang@tufts.edu).
[8/8/2012 6:02:38 AM | Removed 6:03:03 AM] Kirk Morris: This message has been removed.
[8/8/2012 7:19:42 AM] Sara Farmer: Nice to meet you Natalie. and btw good work!
[8/8/2012 7:30:07 AM] Natalie C: Thank you, Sara :)
[8/8/2012 7:30:41 AM] Kirk Morris: hey Nat... welcome home
[8/8/2012 7:31:22 AM] Tausif: nice! people around :)
[8/8/2012 3:12:11 PM] Sara Farmer: Oooh... saw this... "Later this year some 1M resolution cameras will be mounted on the outside of the Internaitonal Space Station (ISS) for HADR. So that means that video will be avail of an event from within minutes of the event up to 90 minutes depending on where the ISS is in orbit to the event."
[8/8/2012 5:55:58 PM] Tausif: any event happening in India?
[8/8/2012 6:45:35 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: excellent place to look/watch for any/all events

[8/8/2012 6:47:09 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: flash floods in India..  http://hisz.rsoe.hu/alertmap/site/?pageid=event_summary&edis_id=FF-20120804-36049-IND
[8/8/2012 6:47:55 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: hope that helps, @Tausif! :)
[8/9/2012 4:08:23 PM] Melissa Elliott: Hey all!  Curious to know who's going to ICCM2012 from our team.  We DEFINITELY want to plan a SBTF meetup and, you know, hug it out. ;)
[8/9/2012 4:09:06 PM] Melissa Elliott: http://crisismappers.net/page/iccm-washington-2012
[8/9/2012 4:47:33 PM] Heather Leson: yes
[8/9/2012 4:47:45 PM] Heather Leson: bought my ticket, have a planning meeting tonight : )
[8/9/2012 6:06:24 PM] ajperez80: Hi Melissa, I hoping to attend the conference, but wondering if there will be a webcast of it if we arent able to come?
[8/9/2012 8:35:50 PM] Melissa Elliott: in a perfect world yes. not sure it's going to happen though. Where are you located?
[8/9/2012 8:53:12 PM] ajperez80: by October I will be back home in California
[8/9/2012 11:28:48 PM] om SBTF: At least some posted notes :)
[8/10/2012 2:27:14 AM] Sara Farmer: I'm there!
[8/10/2012 9:59:38 AM] Melissa Elliott: awesome!
[8/10/2012 10:03:08 AM] Sara Farmer: We rigged up a video last time (via Christiaan Adams and his webcam) so people outside the conference could see what was happening and feed back to it.  Hopefully this time there'll be something a little more sophisticated than that going on :)
[8/10/2012 10:08:40 AM] Heather Leson: it was a google hangout for days.  We have time to plan that. Melissa, maybe I can cohort with Christiaan?
[8/10/2012 10:09:10 AM] Melissa Elliott:  Its ok - it's in the works with him already
[8/10/2012 10:09:32 AM] Sara Farmer: Good. We need something that lots of people can access though - G+ is limited in numbers.
[8/10/2012 10:10:06 AM] Melissa Elliott: even a Ustream is better than that
[8/10/2012 10:10:21 AM] Melissa Elliott: I have G+ hangouts for that. downloading software, etc. gross
[8/10/2012 10:10:26 AM] Sara Farmer: We need both a video feed out, and a backchannel in.
[8/10/2012 10:10:36 AM] Melissa Elliott: Ustream does that
[8/10/2012 10:40:26 AM] Sara Farmer: Cool. We have a good candidate solution then... all we need now is a camera in the venue.
[8/10/2012 11:43:07 AM] Kirk Morris: who did the USAID, Wilson Center video live feed?
[8/10/2012 11:43:42 AM] Kirk Morris: Patrick knows them well
[8/10/2012 3:41:23 PM] Patrick Meier: TechChange, yes, might be worth asking them. They're doing the DHN simulation for ICCM
[8/10/2012 3:44:55 PM] Melissa Elliott: will do
[8/10/2012 6:03:50 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: If my health allows, I am there!
[8/10/2012 6:04:10 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: at this time, I do plan on coming with Donna and Christina!!
[8/10/2012 8:36:39 PM] om SBTF: What about Buzzume? It was made for this.
[8/10/2012 9:12:33 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: sounds fun? what is Buzzume?
[8/10/2012 9:57:10 PM] om SBTF: https://buzzumi.com/ it was actually built by one of ours.. the Blog shows off some really cool capabilities http://blog.buzzumi.com/
[8/10/2012 10:01:26 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: (party) \o/ gonna wait till morning for all the excitement of checking it out.. (yawn) |-) (o) for me.. long day.. THanks so much, @Om.. was hoping you would give me link.. cant wait to see!
[8/11/2012 4:08:10 AM] Sara Farmer: Yay!
[8/11/2012 8:35:23 AM] Sara Farmer: Meanwhile is difficult for me to watch disasters going by (Philippines floods, Iran earthquake) whilst I'm head-down in the data work.  Am consoling self with the though that the data work will be useful to lots more disasters in the future.
[8/11/2012 1:15:03 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: I am sure all the disasters of the world know you, @Sara are with them... working in background to help make this world a better place! (hug)
[8/11/2012 1:31:04 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: Two powerful earthquakes struck northwest Iran Saturday, killing at least 87 people and injuring 600 more, state media reported.

The U.S. Geological survey measured the first quake, which struck 37 miles northeast of the city Tabriz, at 3:25 p.m. (6:55 a.m. ET) with a 6.4 magnitude. The second quake, which occurred 11 minutes later, struck an area about 30 miles northeast of Tabriz with a 6.3 magnitude.

[8/13/2012 7:05:54 AM] Jus Mackinnon: At 18:00 GMT tonight, CrisisMappersUK are ending the London Olympic deployment. 18 days with amazing volunteers. Thank goodness it wasn't needed in a reactionary way. It has provided us with further understanding how effective the tools can be in a preparedness format. We will be holding a webinar in the near future to discuss. Please let me know if anyone is interested in participating. Once again we have been so fortunate to have amazing volunteers!
[8/13/2012 10:26:44 AM] Melissa Elliott: Congratulations Jus!  Saw the press on this via CBC (Canada).
[8/13/2012 10:26:51 AM] Melissa Elliott: Great job!
[8/13/2012 10:27:08 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Thank you Melissa x

[8/14/2012 4:47:13 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: @Nigel.. thanks for the reminder.. wanted to check it out.. doing now. (bow)
[8/14/2012 4:49:50 PM] Nigel McNie: :)
[8/14/2012 4:50:21 PM] Nigel McNie: it should still look and work in a similar fashion to before, but we have completely new video tech under the hood
[8/14/2012 4:51:28 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: Nigel.. I have the latest version of firefox.. yet it ALWAYS says my browser is out of date at several web places.. says I have 4.3 or 4.5. any way to get it to read the correct version?
[8/14/2012 4:54:18 PM] Nigel McNie: you have version 4.3 or 4.5?
[8/14/2012 4:54:23 PM] Nigel McNie: Firefox is up to like version 14 now
[8/14/2012 4:54:48 PM] Nigel McNie: Firefox 4 is now very old
[8/14/2012 4:55:15 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: no, i have version 14
[8/14/2012 4:55:31 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: but in google, and even buzzumi it reads as an old version
[8/14/2012 4:55:34 PM] Nigel McNie: ah ok. So are you seeing the old browser message on buzz?
[8/14/2012 4:55:36 PM] Nigel McNie: oh interesting...
[8/14/2012 4:55:41 PM] Nigel McNie: that will be a bug on our side
[8/14/2012 4:55:46 PM] Nigel McNie: hm
[8/14/2012 4:55:47 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: NOOO
[8/14/2012 4:55:49 PM] Nigel McNie: can you please do something for me
[8/14/2012 4:55:59 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: its says same thing in google mail/docs etc
[8/14/2012 4:56:00 PM] Nigel McNie: in the help menu for firefox, there's an About option
[8/14/2012 4:56:05 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: i have firefox 14.0.1
[8/14/2012 4:56:11 PM] Nigel McNie: and I think if you choose that, you'll see a big long string
[8/14/2012 4:56:24 PM] Nigel McNie: and it will have Mozilla/5.0 in it somewhere or something like that
[8/14/2012 4:56:28 PM] Nigel McNie: can you paste that to me please?
[8/14/2012 4:56:45 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: ah, Buzzumi says I am running Firefox version 3.5.5
[8/14/2012 4:57:06 PM] Nigel McNie: hrm.
[8/14/2012 4:57:10 PM] Nigel McNie: and what does Help -> About say?
[8/14/2012 4:58:12 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: Firefoz 14.0.1 then under says Firefox is up to date next line You are currently on the release update channel
[8/14/2012 4:58:35 PM] Nigel McNie: right. Are you using a browser extension that lets you fake your user agent?
[8/14/2012 4:59:06 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: this has been going on for sometime.. then it just happened again and thought maybe you could guide me.
[8/14/2012 4:59:06 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: hmmm
[8/14/2012 4:59:12 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: browser extention?

[8/14/2012 5:01:42 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: (wave)
[8/14/2012 5:01:50 PM] Nigel McNie: so that'll be why
[8/14/2012 5:01:55 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: why is that? how do i change it?
[8/14/2012 5:02:15 PM] Nigel McNie: did you install that browser yourself and are you (almost always) the only user?
[8/14/2012 5:02:23 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: yes
[8/14/2012 5:02:26 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: always
[8/14/2012 5:02:45 PM] Nigel McNie: have you ever installed a browser extension?
[8/14/2012 5:02:48 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: i have cleared caches.. i do extensive computer files/registry cleaning regularly
[8/14/2012 5:02:59 PM] Nigel McNie: caches won't matter in this case
[8/14/2012 5:03:02 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: doesnt each browser have its own extentions?
[8/14/2012 5:03:35 PM] Nigel McNie: yes. Let me modify my question - have you ever installed a browser extension in that particular browser on that computer?
[8/14/2012 5:04:08 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: yes, I have extentions in my firefox
[8/14/2012 5:04:23 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: should i go and look at the extentions i have for firefox now?
[8/14/2012 5:04:31 PM] Nigel McNie: yes please, please paste a list of them
[8/14/2012 5:06:18 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: took screenshot.. let me put in your private window..
[8/14/2012 5:07:35 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: didnt think all of SBTF wanted my screenshot of my firefox extensions.. (chuckle)
[8/14/2012 5:08:27 PM] om SBTF: To all... anyone interested to do some geo helping for Iran please get intouch with me here. The task requires some basic experience with GIS and/or willingness to learn a web interface. I'll collect responses later tonight.. Om
[8/14/2012 5:08:35 PM] Nigel McNie: right, you're loaded with extensions
[8/14/2012 5:08:45 PM] Nigel McNie: that screenshot just shows the top of the extensions list
[8/14/2012 5:09:05 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: do you want the rest of the screen?
[8/14/2012 5:09:09 PM] Nigel McNie: could you have a look down the list and see if you can see anything like "user agent switcher" or anything with "user agent" or "browser version" or similar in the name?
[8/14/2012 5:09:36 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: yes. will look now
[8/14/2012 5:10:31 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: no, nothing that has any of those words.
[8/14/2012 5:11:06 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: there is only personas, pocket and RSS ticker left.. others are not active
[8/14/2012 5:11:19 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: and even in disabled, nothing with those words
[8/14/2012 5:11:44 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: @Om.. i will paste your messaage again when I am finished so its not lost. :)
[8/14/2012 5:11:46 PM] Nigel McNie: ok, so next trick would be to shut down your browser, open it in Safe Mode (which doesn't load any extensions), re-visit http://getyourgameon.co.nz/ and let me know
[8/14/2012 5:11:54 PM] Nigel McNie: that will tell us if one of your extensions is doing the messing about
[8/14/2012 5:12:12 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: how do i reopen my browser in safe mode?
[8/14/2012 5:12:25 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: I know how to do computer, but not browser
[8/14/2012 5:12:45 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: just go on and disable them all
[8/14/2012 5:12:50 PM] Nigel McNie: You might have to google it, it will vary based on your OS
[8/14/2012 5:12:54 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: then reopen?
[8/14/2012 5:13:07 PM] Nigel McNie: on windows, normally there's an option in the menu next to the Firefox option
[8/14/2012 5:13:09 PM] Nigel McNie: basically
[8/14/2012 5:13:12 PM] Nigel McNie: shut browser down
[8/14/2012 5:13:15 PM] Nigel McNie: then open using Safe Mode

[8/14/2012 5:32:17 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: yes
[8/14/2012 5:32:34 PM] Nigel McNie: actually
[8/14/2012 5:32:55 PM] Nigel McNie: my colleague suggests that your firefox might need a malware scan
[8/14/2012 5:33:49 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: oh, I scan.. did not see useragent..
[8/14/2012 5:34:08 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: i have tons of protection and I do regular scans for spy/mal/virus/etc
[8/14/2012 5:34:19 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: due to nature of my work, i am careful

[8/14/2012 5:34:55 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: I can/will certainly run a scan if you think i should
[8/14/2012 5:35:02 PM] Nigel McNie: well, I don't have any other ideas sadly
[8/14/2012 5:35:21 PM] Nigel McNie: my colleague, who doesn't run windows, was quick to offer that observation, which suggests to me he knows that people have been bitten that way before
[8/14/2012 5:36:01 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: ok, will do now.. malware bytes?
[8/14/2012 5:36:13 PM] Nigel McNie: que?

[8/14/2012 5:36:47 PM] Nigel McNie: yes
[8/14/2012 5:37:03 PM] Nigel McNie: scan the Firefox program in particular if you can, a full scan is fine too
[8/14/2012 5:37:05 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: I have a program i use called malware bytes.. i think
[8/14/2012 5:37:11 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: ok, will do now
[8/14/2012 5:37:20 PM] Nigel McNie: oh I see. I don't run malware scanners, I know nothing about them
[8/14/2012 5:37:40 PM] Nigel McNie: other than that apparently they can mess up programs that are running fine otherwise
[8/14/2012 5:37:49 PM] Nigel McNie: Nigel McNie is careful by not using windows :D

[8/14/2012 6:56:34 PM] Nigel McNie: hrm.
[8/14/2012 6:56:41 PM] Nigel McNie: I think we're out of ideas, short of reinstalling entirely
[8/14/2012 6:56:58 PM] Nigel McNie: or googling. I haven't googled "firefox reports version incorrectly" or anything like that
[8/14/2012 6:59:17 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: duh.. now there is an idea.. google! LOL.. I forget about what i regularly do for everything/everyone else.. I could just reinstall also.. so long as my bookmarks are not lost.. they are worth (cash) (cash) (cash)

Will that be including the US at some point or do you know if another map exists for US landfall?
[8/26/2012 8:41:55 PM] Heather Leson: HI Donna, that particular map has a mission and plan from the team. Perhaps it might be best for someone (a team) to plan a project for the US.
[8/26/2012 8:42:30 PM] Heather Leson: I will search, but if you plan on doing this please be sure to see the toolboxes on the wiki.ushahidi.com. And review some of the feedback about Hurricane Irene.

I am a Red Cross member, locally as well as digitally, and would love to direct local governments and Red Cross/Salvation army to anything that may come up of use to response efforts

[8/29/2012 8:00:39 AM] Sara Farmer: So - when I get back to the US, what's a good set of things for me to have in the house?  I have a generator and fuel (so I can keep the laptop and mobile running - Dan wants to have light, but I don't see that as important); 7 days' supply of food and catfood (is that enough - should it be 3 weeks?); big water containers ready to fill (and a well if that fails); storm lanterns and a propane heater.  Forgot to add the alcohol to the list though.
[8/29/2012 8:01:16 AM] Sara Farmer: Think I need to improve our first-aid kit though.

[8/29/2012 10:22:07 AM] Sara Farmer: I didn't see any data on it last night.
[8/29/2012 10:22:21 AM] Heather Leson: it isn't there yet
[8/29/2012 10:22:28 AM] Melissa Elliott: there was almost none on it. they don't really know what they are doing
[8/29/2012 10:22:38 AM] Kirk Morris: BIG lesson of Irene... never mount a map unless there is a clear concept and direct beneficiary
[8/29/2012 10:22:47 AM] Heather Leson: let's hope they heed my questions
[8/29/2012 10:23:40 AM] Sara Farmer: THey might not.  IF there's no data, then don't promote the map. Anything from the news agencies yet?
[8/29/2012 10:23:42 AM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: Thankyou, we do have that listed somewhere.. at the moment, belive my blog has the google map up
[8/29/2012 10:23:56 AM | Edited 10:24:09 AM] Melissa Elliott: apparently:  VOST Admin Team for Hurricane Isaac Info conferenced with them yesterday afternoon - They are coordinating with EMA and other agencies
[8/29/2012 10:24:25 AM] Heather Leson: ok. Well, I have offered from ushahidi, point of view, to give them some pointers and connections.
[8/29/2012 10:24:52 AM] Heather Leson: ok, back to planning on putting melissa on a stage : )
[8/29/2012 10:24:56 AM] Sara Farmer: one thing we do now about running maps - it does take an awful lot of people to do well.
[8/29/2012 10:25:02 AM] Sara Farmer: know*
[8/29/2012 10:25:12 AM] Heather Leson: support, teach, train : )
[8/29/2012 10:25:27 AM] Melissa Elliott: this is exactly the convo I want to have with them
[8/29/2012 10:25:31 AM] Heather Leson: someday they will be mapsters : )

[8/29/2012 10:25:40 AM] Heather Leson: you are the first person I will contact
[8/29/2012 10:25:57 AM] Sara Farmer: Aha!  The Canadian Conspiracy Continues!
[8/29/2012 10:26:02 AM] Melissa Elliott: haha!
[8/29/2012 10:26:02 AM] Heather Leson: on that - have you read Heather Ford's report on verification? I have plans for a webinar on her learnings

[8/29/2012 1:11:45 PM] Jus Mackinnon: just let me know what you need me to do and where and what about and I am up for anything. lol
[8/29/2012 1:14:46 PM] Jus Mackinnon: Juliana (Who I didn't realise who she was) contacted me and asked if I will do a talk with her in London.... I asked if she had got the right person!
[8/29/2012 1:15:17 PM] Heather Leson: I sent her to you
[8/29/2012 1:15:42 PM] Jus Mackinnon: I should have guessed lol !!! I bowed to her and told her how amazing she is!
[8/29/2012 1:15:45 PM] Heather Leson: we aim to have as many deployers talking as possible.

[8/31/2012 11:58:32 AM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: At this time, SBTF& Info4 services have concluded for the Isaac side deployment. We all are a temporary support team to assist in the setting up of maps to then hand off to the person/persons who originally requested services. There are now 2 other hurricanes in the Atlantic and at this time, we are freeing up resources to be able to deploy again if needed. I want to thank ALL of you who have participated. Please take this long weekend to regroup and spend time with family and friends.
[8/31/2012 1:06:45 PM] Sara Farmer: THanks Leesa.  We got some good tech work done, and are setting up a tech skypechat for people from all groups who want to continue with this.
[8/31/2012 1:11:46 PM] Kirk Morris: do not associate sbtf with any of it, please

[8/31/2012 1:20:50 PM] Sara Farmer: And Robbie gave us some cool code to download the messages out of an Ushahidi instance.
[8/31/2012 1:23:23 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: my fave, so far, was that the RTs automatically remove from themselves.. (with yalls wonderful code) from the platform.. (party)

[9/4/2012 12:11:07 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Hi Sara. What's the final verdict on that code work with Pat last week?
[9/4/2012 12:11:38 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Just wondrin' as I am no code guru.
[9/5/2012 6:47:41 AM] Sara Farmer: We built the Tweak the Tweet to Ushahidi format converter - Pat was working on a continuous feed between the two systems.  We haven't built the retweet-stripper yet because to do it well needs some serious thinking about natural language processing. Which has been happening.  Unfortunately, we got locked out of the Isaac site before we could download a set of example inputs to test it on.

[9/17/2012 9:07:56 AM] Melissa Elliott: Brandon Greenberg is based in the NYC metro area and has more than 10 years of operations, planning and training experience in emergency preparedness and response, and homeland security. He has designed and developed many exercises under different exercise programs. In 2009, he supported the design and development of National Level Exercise 2009. Throughout his consulting career, he has supported key federal, regional, and state clients and is a Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) Train-the-Trainer.

From 2002 to 2007, Mr. Greenberg worked in a number of urban and suburban EMS systems including hospital-based, volunteer, private, and fire-based advanced and basic life support systems, including the NYC area. Since 2002, he has instructed exercise and disaster operations methodologies and responded to a number of high profile events including EMS response to the 2003 Blackout and National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) deployment to Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 Democratic National Convention. He also continues to work as a Federal medical responder for the NDMS with a Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) based in the NYC metro area.

Brandon holds a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration from the University of Denver, a Graduate Certificate in Community Preparedness and Disaster Management from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is currently pursuing a Masters of Public Administration at NYUs Wagner School of Public Service.

[9/19/2012 7:39:35 AM] Sara Farmer: H - I've been asking for a tarpaulin-counter since Haiti: good to see that someone's finally built one (I assume that's what dis.placed has done - used satellite imagery and image processing to find and count tents / tarpaulins in refugee camps?)
[9/19/2012 7:40:05 AM] Sara Farmer: @Om :)
[9/19/2012 8:23:20 AM] Heather Leson: Perhaps contact them?
[9/19/2012 9:07:44 AM] Sara Farmer: @H perhaps. Better yet to link them up with people who need this sort of app. Jonas/David/Keera: are you around?  Would this be interesting to your contacts in the South Sudan camps?
[9/19/2012 9:08:33 AM] Heather Leson: recommendations on who I should connect them with?
[9/19/2012 9:12:52 AM] Sara Farmer: That was my first recommendation.  The South Sudan team have been talking to the OCHA people in the field there for a while now - that would be the first place I'd think of.
[9/19/2012 9:14:21 AM] Sara Farmer: Other than that, I'd send an email out to crisismappers googlegroup, to grab attention of anyone who's thinking of doing this right now.  Rest of the peeps I can think of aren't at the stage yet where this can be integrated into what they do.
[9/19/2012 9:14:55 AM] Sara Farmer: If we get another Haiti anytime soon, it would probably be us passing on the data from it.

[9/26/2012 11:21:12 AM] Melissa Elliott: Dated: Sept 25th 2012 & Deadline Oct 5th 2012
 
*Innovative Mapper Needed to Make a Poverty Solutions Map*
 
Global MapAid is a vibrant little NGO whose Patron is Desmond Tutu.
Our mission is to make and disseminate simple maps that show solutions to
unemployment poverty.
 
*UK Poverty Solution Map*
 
We have been working on collecting data of 1) unemployment in the UK and
also 2) vocational education in the UK. We have used Post Codes as a basis.
We now want to make ratios of vocational education places to unemployment
figures and match these to parliamentary constituencies. Ratios will
correspond to colour intensity.
 
No map is ever scientifically perfect, however the results will provide a
strategy tool to UK leadership at various levels, including those working
on youth employability.
 
*Requirements*
 
Vitally, the person we need to work on this must have:-
 
A) the time and energy to do the job, this means at least a day a week.
Capable to working to a deadline and 'checking-in' with weekly updates.
 
B) be a total self-starter and capable of out-thinking all problems
with a resolve of steel.
 
C) check their email twice a day and have a cell phone switched on where
they can be reached more than 70% of the time, even if only to fix a Skype
call.
 
Our current project mapper has now got a genuine time issue. The person who
takes on the task will need to listen and understand how our current mapper
has solved this situation and made an example map for London. The new
mapper will not necessarily be expected to adopt the initial London
technical solution, but they will be expected to get the job done with
minimal fuss. It may (to be discussed) involve a visit to our current
project mapper, for which GMA will pay rail, bus or fuel costs in the UK,
therefore living in the UK or passing through would be an advantage.
 
Apply with with resum and covering email or letter.
 
Please only apply if you have thought this through carefully and have fully
evaluated your other commitments for the next 6 months.
 
This is a voluntary unpaid position, but will result in a good reference on
successful completion.
 
*Please email this to others who might be interested.*
 
Deadline for applications 5th October 2012 to
rupertdouglasbate@globalmapaid.org
 
Thank you.

[9/26/2012 5:12:23 PM] bartender.moe: Hi, guys. Good to meet ya. I will have to dive to bed now, but I hope to catch you all real soon. Having lived in Sudan I really look forward to check out this project.
[9/26/2012 9:53:12 PM] arlduc: Hi guys, are any of you based in Indonesia? Or do you know mappers there? I've spoken with some of you-- I'm part of an MIT research project (http://openir.media.mit.edu), and I'm doing field tests there in January.
[9/27/2012 2:42:54 AM] Sara Farmer: Hi Arlene - some of the mappers in the ACAPS deployment are in Indonesia at the moment.
[9/27/2012 2:43:34 AM] Sara Farmer: Christina Dryden and Kate, for example.
[9/27/2012 2:44:34 AM] Sara Farmer: Another thing to do is search the Ning site for anyone connected with a country... e.g. http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/main/search/search?q=indonesia
[9/27/2012 3:26:53 AM] Sara Farmer: BTW, I flipped open a copy of the Readers' Digest at my parents' place yesterday (yes, yes, I know) and found this in an article ("The World is Watching", Jo Carlowe, July 2012 pp77-81): "The amateur crisis-tracking internet group, the Standby Task Force, meanwhile, has focussed its attention on Syria, using satellite images and other modern tools (such as GPS and text messaging) to create live maps of probable human-rights abuses - including tagging the location of hundreds of Syrian tanks. Amnesty International hopes eventually to use this data to bring abusers to justice. The Task Force is also spotting makeshift shelters, allowing the UN's Refugee Agency to deliver aid on the ground".
[9/27/2012 7:10:12 AM] Heather Leson: wow
[9/27/2012 7:16:53 AM] Sara Farmer: Is about time we wrote more about ourselves, so it's not always by someone else.
[9/27/2012 7:30:37 AM] Kirk Morris: yes, but because of security concerns that project was shut down :(
[9/27/2012 7:32:31 AM] Sara Farmer: Yes I know. Which is why we need to get some other SBTF stories into the press, so this isn't the only one.
[9/27/2012 7:32:34 AM] Kirk Morris: Arlene, what Sara said :) Good to see you poking your nose in.
[9/27/2012 7:33:36 AM] Kirk Morris: Sara, with Patricjk stepping back we have no "face." And, we aren't represented at conferences.
[9/27/2012 7:40:18 AM] Sara Farmer: I've been deliberately labelling myself as SBTF at meetings now, because oftentimes we're the only team without a representative, and in general we're way more active than the others and need to get credit for that.  It's up to all of us now... if you're SBTF, if you've been working deployments, have got skills through working here, have insights to share from it, then consider stepping up and representing.
[9/27/2012 7:47:50 AM] Kirk Morris: cool.  but I'm not footing the freight :)
[9/27/2012 7:48:49 AM] Sara Farmer: We have mappers all over the world. THere are meetings all over the world.  We have people going to meetings all over the world. If you're going to one, consider talking about the SBTF at it!
[9/27/2012 7:50:09 AM] Kirk Morris: on that piece of advice i'm off to earn a pay check
[9/27/2012 7:56:42 AM] Sara Farmer: Me too. In-between ACAPs coordination chats.
[9/27/2012 7:58:18 AM] Sara Farmer: We've just added mappers to each data team.  Visualisations and gis, here we come...
[9/27/2012 8:08:00 AM] Christina Dryden: Hi All! Have we got anyone with experience in infographics design or mapping data that is not allready involved in the DRC deployment?  Anyone interested in joining the deployment would be very welcome! Just send a chat request to Bharathi, myself or Sara... or indicate in here that you are interested and whether your skills are in mapping or infographics.  Sign up on the Ning page and have a read of the instructions and we can get you started!  It is going to be a busy weekend and we already have some great data!
[9/27/2012 8:28:55 AM] Kirk Morris: did Estella ever show up?
[9/27/2012 8:38:47 AM] Sara Farmer: Nope. Although we know she's live and well from her other feeds, so have stopped worrying about whether she's safe.
[9/27/2012 8:43:28 AM] Kirk Morris: wise :)
[9/27/2012 8:47:58 AM] Arlene Ducao: Thanks for your Indonesia suggestions, Sara, hi Kirk & Heather, and... I know an Engineering for Change reporter, maybe I can put him in touch with you about a possible SBTF story?
[9/27/2012 8:49:15 AM] Kirk Morris: Arlene... thanks, sounds good.

[10/4/2012 10:14:51 AM] Kirk Morris: then when they land there... each individual geofeedia report needs two action check boxes... "delete" and "forward to reports" where they's show up on the "normal" reports page

[10/5/2012 12:01:18 PM] [OCHA] Luis Hernando Aguilar: Hi friends
[10/5/2012 12:01:57 PM] [OCHA] Luis Hernando Aguilar:  for your information...
 I just talked with Colombian government dissaster aggency and we will use Ushahidi in a mayor drill next October 17. 30+ cities involved on evacuation and almost all the teams involved on the process. In 2009 we move 3 million people just in the capital Bogota, so this time may be the same or more. In 2009 we used ushahidi just for testing that on eartquake (previous to Haiti's) but this time will be spreaded by mass media... so can happen that will have few reports or huge ammount of them.
 I'll ask here if we face any challenge on that.
 (I just putted this on ushahidi chat)
[10/5/2012 12:04:34 PM] Christina Kraich-Rogers: that's fantastic

[10/5/2012 4:00:51 PM] Melissa Elliott: Luis, are you asking if you'll face a challenge using media to do the drill?  as in social media (Twitter, FB, etc)?
[10/5/2012 4:01:35 PM] Melissa Elliott: If so, first and foremost, would be to ensure that it's very clear that this is a drill, and not really happening.  Especially as things get RT'd and ppl remove parts of messages...
[10/5/2012 4:15:01 PM] Kirk Morris: Luis, let's continue our conversation over the weekend, ok?
[10/5/2012 4:17:11 PM] Leesa@Info4Disasters [SBTF-HumanResource]: posting prior to disaster drills that it is going to happen is paramount to these drills.. IMHO

[10/28/2012 3:32:06 PM | Edited 3:34:53 PM] Melissa Elliott: (*) Hi all. Members of the VTC community 'may' be asked to assist in compiling information in relation to the effects of Hurricane Sandy.  Given all of the learnings from past natural disasters with volunteers jumping in to help (and often overloading already max'd responders with info), there is considerable effort being taken to wait until response orgs know exactly what kind of info they need before the community dives in full steam.
[10/28/2012 3:32:44 PM] Melissa Elliott: Just posting this here as an update in case people where wondering how/when to help.
[10/28/2012 3:34:17 PM | Edited 3:35:02 PM] Melissa Elliott: The SBTF does not self-activate - we wait for an activation request. However, given the extensive knowledge and suport of our SBTF community, there 'may' be a call for hands posted here - once the need is determined. (*)

[10/30/2012 7:06:55 AM] Sara Farmer: Have lost contact with my partner - nothing since early last night - I know he's probably okay, but if I'm feeling a bit sick with worry here, I can only imagine what people across New York and New Jersey who've been right under the storm are feeling right now.
[10/30/2012 7:23:11 AM] Sara Farmer: Found him!
[10/30/2012 7:50:51 AM] Kirk Morris: New Jersey seems to have survived intact with the major problem being loss of power. There was no River flooding to speak of most of the damaged by water was through the storm surge. New York City suffered the greatest as a result of the surge and the high tide last night. You back you waited patience successfully from NYU Medical Center. All East River tunnels are closed due to water seepage and some flooding.

I will be back in the coming days and bringing more volunteers for the 'aftermath' as we are needed. I'm so proud of you all and feel that a moment of reflection is in order. The efforts, messaging, coordination, public and government awareness was all better than it has ever been before and it is owed in no small part to all of you here for changing opinions and proving what is possible for the past few years. It is my absolute pleasure to be associated and involved. Here's to what can be! and what we will make it become. Cheers! Sweet dreams!!!
[11/1/2012 2:06:37 PM] Heather Leson: Ditto on those thoughts. And, Om - good luck with the move and seasons.

[Monday, November 05, 2012 1:06 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: 

<<< Leesa is home in New Orleans now and Christina & I just got to a library with power & internet for the first time since before the storm.
We are ok, but had to evacuate home which, although dry (thank goodness) has had no power for a week and it may take awhile yet.
It was getting very cold.
[11/5/2012 1:12:24 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Friends got power back so we are there now.
[11/5/2012 1:13:09 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: Finally back on at a library with power & wireless.
(bow)Thank you to Bethpage Public Library!
 http://www.nassaulibrary.org/bethpage/
[11/6/2012 7:36:19 AM] Sara Farmer: Hi Donna - good to see you're okay. We're still without power over here, but houses down the street from us got power yesterday, so we're hopeful.  Needless to say, my parents insisted on coming to stay with us, despite the threat of cold showers!
[11/6/2012 7:37:00 AM] Sara Farmer: BTW, our local YMCA was offering hot showers to people without power - maybe there's something similar happening near you?
[11/9/2012 1:49:24 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: @Sara How are you doing?
[11/9/2012 1:50:33 PM] Donna Lee Weber @Info4Disasters: We are still at friend's with power. They just got wireless/cable back yesterday also, so as long as it lasts I can work again.  Woohoo!
[11/11/2012 10:42:35 AM] Sara Farmer: Woot indeed... we got power back t'other day... has been a bit exciting, finding out just how much we normally do with electricity.
[11/13/2012 9:27:10 AM] Kirk Morris: Think carefully regarding donations and crisis, disaster. The nature and makeup of first responders is changing. Citizens are assuming the role far better than the larger NGOs and in particular (in the US) the Red Cross. For Sandy and the NYC area it's become apparent the #occupysandy citizen group with recovers.org has taken a leadership role. It's been acknowledeg by FEMA, the Mayors office and the National Guard. In the citizen there is power. Feliz Salamon of Reuters has seen the light supporting my contention. Look local when you're wanting to donate, support crisis response. http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/11/12/the-problem-with-the-red-cross/ --- http://interoccupy.net/occupysandy/ --- https://statenisland.recovers.org/ -- Kuddos to #occupysandy http://news.yahoo.com/occupy-sandy-onetime-protesters-cause-074517400.html
[11/13/2012 9:35:01 AM] Sara Farmer: Yep - they've really stepped up to the plate on this one.  I've been thinking, and Sandy has made me think that there's a lot of value in strengthening local groups that work year-round on non-crisis things, and making sure they have the tools available for crisis management as needed.
[11/13/2012 9:35:45 AM] Sara Farmer: This article in particular started me thinking about how little help people could expect from big government in the US: http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/11/6539226/after-sandy-great-and-complex-city-reveals-traumas-new-and-old?page=all
[11/13/2012 9:39:16 AM] Kirk Morris: recovers.org can be the tool
[11/13/2012 9:41:29 AM] Sara Farmer: It can... but communities need to know about it before they get to an emergency.
[11/13/2012 9:43:21 AM] Sara Farmer: Maybe there's a new role for FEMA there - helping communities to build in their own resilience?
[11/13/2012 9:46:10 AM] Kirk Morris: naw... too big
[11/13/2012 9:47:32 AM] Sara Farmer: Yes, too big to do... but might be able to inform?  Or maybe a network of communities might work better?
[11/13/2012 9:54:21 AM] Kirk Morris: nope... I'm convinced recovers.org is right... just has to be marketed... and they've got the support of occupy. I will talk to occupy about pushing recovers thru occupy nationallly
[11/13/2012 9:57:49 AM] Sara Farmer: Sounds good. Have seen 3 recovers.orgs across NYC so far, and lots of good occupy work with them... plenty of stories to be had from their work, to help keep up the media profile.

[11/13/2012 10:18:22 AM] Melissa Elliott: Welcome to you all!  The SBTF is currently not deployed.  We encourage you to review the training material found here: http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/page/training-1   and to play with our Ushahidi test site here: http://training.ops.standbytaskforce.com as the majority of our deployments utilize this tool.  Each deployment comes with it's own set of instructions and nuances, but the training documents and test site are the best place to start.

This window is our general chat window, where we chat between deployments and share information.  The history has been turned on, so you should be able to see the last 400 comments made.  

Please let us know if you have any questions & welcome to the team!

[11/13/2012 2:05:56 PM] rodrigodavies: if anyone needs to connect with the hurricane hackers directly, let me know - the group emerged out of the center for civic media, where i'm based. would be great if some SBTF people could make it to the hackathon!
[11/14/2012 9:27:37 AM] Sara Farmer: I'm going to be there, at least for the first few hours. Look for a tallish blonde person with a Scraperwiki sticker on their laptop.
[11/21/2012 9:11:31 AM] Sara Farmer: Hey all.  I just got off the phone from a debrief with the ACAPS team.  Remember that deployment earlier this year?  They got a request for DR Congo data yesterday, and sent our data as part of the response!
[11/21/2012 9:11:34 AM] Sara Farmer: Meeting notes are:
[11/21/2012 9:11:36 AM] Sara Farmer: Post-deployment discussion with ACAPS on deployment, next steps etc. 
3 main topics for today: 
* Look back at the deployment, and the lessons learnt.
* Progress update on code built for the deployment (e.g. web scrapers)
* Next steps for ACAPS and SBTF

Updates: 
* ACAPS got a request from DR Congo to do data collection on Goma yesterday. Part of the response was to share the DR Congo data that SBTF collected - the field team reported that this was useful to them. 
* ACAPS also presented this work to UNOCHA Task Force (inc Andrej Verity, IM Task Force from UNHCR, OCHA, ICRC) in Geneva - ACAPS shared the SBTF-gathered data with participants, who were also interested in these outputs. 
* UNOCHA New York is also working on crisis indicator collection, and has asked SBTF to help with an upcoming example deployment on this. SBTF thinks that UNOCHA and ACAPS should be talking to each other about overlaps in this work (SJF: possibly a joint data collection deployment?). Action on SaraF to introduce Leonie Tax (ACAPS) and Sarah Telford (UNOCHA) to each other.
* The ACAPS team has been too busy to publish its DR Congo report yet, but will keep SBTF in the loop about what happens.

Lessons learnt: 
* ACAPS is writing a policy for working with VTCs like SBTF. This includes when to call in crowdsourcing, and what to expect on both sides. Organisations considered in this include SBTF and UNV.
ACAPS had difficulty finding out what the final outputs were.  Need to include a handover meeting post-deployment, so can tell this. 
* SBTF needed more guidance from ACAPS on the mapping. ACAPS stepped back to see what the GIS mappers could do with the data, and were impressed with it, but in future will give more guidance to the mapping team on which data is more important to them. 
* Names and categories need to be settled before the deployment start. We agreed that this is more likely in future deployments, and that a first deployment always has some settling-in and changes happening in these areas as we learn more about the data. 
* ACAPS didn't always know exactly what was going on in the deployment. Daily (or perhaps half-daily) reports from team leads to deployment leads for collation into a bullet-point list of what data was being worked on and what the issues were would have helped here. 
* ACAPS asked for a list of volunteer skills (they were quite surprised by how expert some of the volunteers were).  This could be created from a Ning output of SBTF member skillsets and data from the deployment signup form, but will take some technical work to reduce the load on the deployment leads. 
* ACAPS team were busy during the deployment (crises happen), and didn't have enough time to add the SBTF data into a report, during the deployment, as planned. This should be done for future deployments because it highlights gaps in the data that need to be filled.

Code built for the deployment:
* ACAPS were keen to be able to use the outputs from the SBTF indicator scraping work. The code needs a front-end to make it usable by non-techies, and a version made available either online or as a package that can be downloaded and used without specialist python skills. 

Next Steps:
* ACAPS will allocate data collection to crowdsourcing, and analysis to ACAPS analysts from now on. ACAPS are aware and appreciative of the analysis expertise that SBTF, DataKind etc have, but believe that analysis is done best by one or two analysts, who have an overview of the whole product. 
* ACAPS will go over the SBTF-collected data and put it into their end product (the pre-disaster DNA). ACAPS team will share this with SBTF when it's done. 
* Potential SBTF tech project: restart Ning scraper project, and add deployment form data to the list of in-deployment volunteers' skills (could also be done for languages spoken etc).  
* SBTF will research ways to finish the scraper project - perhaps by writing it up as a RHOK project. 
* Summary of ACAPS next steps: build a "menu" to describe different situations in which ACAPS and VTCs can collaborate, to make starting up deployments easier for ACAPS staff. Work on the information product (DNA) from the SBTF-gathered data. Work on the spreadsheets created by SBTF, i.e. clean them up and use them to create templates to guide future deployments.
[11/21/2012 10:59:37 AM] Melissa Elliott: Sara - will you be sending that as an email to the network via the Ning?  not everyone is in this window
[11/21/2012 12:06:39 PM] Per Aarvik (KHiB): Great summary. So happy that our work was useful, and that possible improvements are logged. Looking forward to future deployments! And then - maybe I dare to ask you guys: What would happen if we (or somebody else) launched a mapping project on the situation in southern Europe? Who was thrown out of their flats, which companies closed down, who was fired due to redundancy, where was a local community project started to help each other, to create new jobs? The map could become packed. And it could tell a story not yet told - to us, to politicians, to creative minds who might have good ideas to share? Do you think this is worth posting as a proposal on the Ning?
[11/21/2012 12:49:48 PM] Heather Leson: Sara- amazing

[11/27/2012 6:17:40 PM] Kirk Morris: So as not to panic Ning is down. http://status.ning.com/
[11/28/2012 10:23:58 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Afternoon, Just wondering if anyone is going to Vienna next week?
[11/28/2012 10:41:30 AM] Melissa Elliott: Svend is going: http://standbytaskforce.ning.com/profile/SvendSchelhorn?xg_source=profiles_memberList
[11/28/2012 10:41:36 AM] Melissa Elliott: (Hi Jus! )
[11/28/2012 10:42:25 AM] Heather Leson: working on my talk right now
[11/28/2012 10:42:30 AM] Heather Leson: hi all
[11/28/2012 10:43:01 AM] Melissa Elliott: (and Heather too ;)
[11/28/2012 10:43:41 AM] Heather Leson: There are a few others. We're on an email chain together
[11/28/2012 11:03:26 AM] Jus Mackinnon: I haven't seen it. When are you arriving Heather? Hi Melissa hope you are well x
[11/28/2012 11:29:48 AM] Sara Farmer: I'm missing it... low on travel funds, and concentrating on dayjob (to create more travel funds) at the moment.  Hope you all have a lovely, lovely time.
[11/28/2012 11:37:37 AM] Heather Leson: Sara, i was funded for this trip (They had applications.). You will be missed. I may pick your brain soon on one topic for it. Jus - Sunday night
[11/28/2012 11:38:55 AM] Jus Mackinnon: @Sara.... Don't worry I am low on ALL funds..... Still smiling and speading the word x
[11/28/2012 11:40:36 AM] Sara Farmer: @H - ah. Drat. My life went a bit crazzy for a while - guess I missed the bit that said they'd pay.  Will be there for the next one...
[11/28/2012 9:02:33 PM] arlduc: Hello, is there anyone using Frontline SMS with Ushahidi? Are you manually geolocating all the SMS messages and turning them into reports, or is there a faster, more automated way? Thanks!
[11/29/2012 10:41:03 AM] Sara Farmer: Hi Arlene. Several groups are using FrontlineSMS with Ushahidi... the FrontlineSMS team is most likely to be keeping a list of them.  And geolocation of SMS messages is a messy subject... at the moment, the SBTF uses a geolocation team for this because a) the location is embedded in the message (i.e. the place that a person sends a message from isn't necessarily the place that they're messaging about); - it's possible to run text filters to find location names in a message, but it's faster at the moment for people to do this; and b) people don't always give clear location information - i.e. some places have multiple spellings, or they're not in the gazetters (the look-up tables that Ushahidi et al use to turn your placename into a lat/long), or they're "outside the Dog and Duck pub" or vague - and the geolocation team spend a lot of their time solving the more interesting puzzles that these messages give them.  We *could* run a format similar to Tweak The Tweet for SMS messages, but that means training a lot of people who aren't used to it, and often have more pressing things on their mind (e.g. survival) at the time they're messaging you.  That's my understanding - I haven't looked in on the GeoLoc team for a little while so they might have found several more solutions by now... guys?  help?
[11/29/2012 2:29:38 PM] Per Aarvik (KHiB): @Arlene: One interesting solution to look into might also be Jacob Rogstadius'  Crisistracker. This software - which is under development - clusters stories rather than locations, and twitterfeeds rather than sms. But the system also needs humans to validate the machine-read feeds and geolocate them. http://ufn.virtues.fi/crisistracker/about.php

[12/1/2012 9:40:56 AM] Sara Farmer: At #nytechresonds hackathon.
[12/1/2012 9:41:02 AM] Sara Farmer: FEMA spokesman: technology has been a vital Sandy response tech has played a major role
[12/1/2012 9:51:20 AM] Sara Farmer: Oh god. This is like Haiti never happened.
[12/1/2012 10:07:07 AM] Sara Farmer: ITDRC spokesperson (Adam Berson) was better... showed tech being used; lots of familiar faces both in the photos and on the logos wall.
[12/1/2012 10:25:17 AM] Sara Farmer: Watching @hornbein from #occupysandy rocking it at #nytechresponds. These guys just plain got stuff done - no crap, no bullshit, just response. Are my heroes for this year.
[12/1/2012 11:05:00 AM] Christina Kraich-Rogers: is there live feed Sara?
[12/1/2012 11:21:35 AM] Sara Farmer: Not sure. Twitter is #nytechresponds
[12/1/2012 11:21:44 AM] Sara Farmer: Info page is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zR242nzGPdxrCPcE2B1ylg4f-sGM5vmpgz7gvfMBv18/preview?sle=true
[12/1/2012 11:22:29 AM] Christina Kraich-Rogers: oh thanks

[12/1/2012 3:40:09 PM] Brandon Greenberg: Hey Sara, I am coming on the hackathon via Alex's computer on Hangout...what is the hack topic?
[12/1/2012 3:43:04 PM] Sara Farmer: @Brandon - which hackathon? There's NyTechResponds and RHOK and the toilet hackathon going on at the moment...
[12/1/2012 3:43:20 PM] Brandon Greenberg: the one you are in right this sec
[12/1/2012 3:43:28 PM] Brandon Greenberg: talking about volunteers/donations, etc.
[12/1/2012 3:43:41 PM] Brandon Greenberg: it is the NYTechResponds one I am talking of
[12/1/2012 3:48:28 PM] Sara Farmer: Aha. I'm in the Sahana 3w (who what where) design conversation.
[12/1/2012 3:51:25 PM] Brandon Greenberg: thanks!
[12/1/2012 7:59:10 PM] Kirk Morris: at landfall Sandy's TS force winds stretched 943 miles along the coast, crushing all records wunderground.com/blog/JeffMaste
[12/1/2012 7:59:22 PM] Kirk Morris: http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/show.html
[12/2/2012 10:57:24 PM] Melissa Elliott: toilet hackathon??  really?
[12/3/2012 4:37:09 AM] Sara Farmer: Melissa - yes, toilet hackathon. It's a very important subject - several of my friends round the world were working on it over the weekend, and Drew from #Occupy and I were geeking out over 1960s-era UK civil defence toilet designs too (was in a little book that I gave them), because bottoms are still bottoms, even after all this techno-evolution...
[12/3/2012 4:38:28 AM] Sara Farmer: Kirk - yes, we watched Sandy break records as it came into the coast.  Meanwhile, have you met Fran and Michael from Sahana yet? Seems like they'd be good people for you to know.
[12/3/2012 4:41:38 AM] Sara Farmer: Meanwhile, NYtech, Occupy et al have been invited to meet with Fema, Red Cross et al on Thursday morning.  I think I'll be in Mexico that day so I'll be hunting down an Internet cafe to join in remotely, but if you're in the area, it might be sensible for a mapper to be there in the flesh.
[12/3/2012 4:43:02 AM] Sara Farmer: And SparkRelief is interested in working out how to work with us too... they're starting to live-map things like open shelters etc during a crisis, so there could be good learning and links to be passed on between us.
[12/3/2012 4:46:58 AM] Sara Farmer: OKay. I'm off on holiday this morning. I'll be working every other day so I'll be checking emails then, but otherwise offline (I need to finish some designs, and spend some time getting my head straight about all the progress that's happened this year and how I can best practically roll up my sleeves and help with it). I'll keep the usual weather-eye out for anything big happening that might need help, but apologies in advance for any tardy responses to non-urgent requests!
[12/3/2012 4:48:30 AM] Sara Farmer: Meanwhile, is anyone keeping an eye on Typhoon Bopha?
[12/3/2012 5:44:21 AM] Sara Farmer: Hmm... Whitney Hess is keeping a memorial wall of people killed by Sandy... if you scroll to the bottom, she's trying to find names for people killed in Haiti and Cuba... can anyone here help? http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2012/11/05/the-people-who-were-killed-by-hurricane-sandy/
[12/3/2012 6:22:38 AM | Removed 6:22:48 AM] Sara Farmer: This message has been removed.
[12/3/2012 6:23:02 AM] Sara Farmer: Svend - crowdflower is here: http://crowdflower.com/
[12/3/2012 6:35:46 AM] Sara Farmer: (*) (*) (*) The SBTF might - repeat "might" - deploy soon on the Philippines / Typhoon Bopha. We don't have exact details yet, and might not be needed this time, but it's likely to need lots of help from the GeoLoc team.  If any of you know where maps and data on the Philippines are already, then can you add them to this document please?   http://bit.ly/Uk53XC
[12/3/2012 6:35:54 AM] Sara Farmer: (*)(*)(*)
[12/3/2012 6:38:29 AM] Keera: sure thing....
[12/3/2012 6:38:56 AM] Sara Farmer: Thanks Keera!  Looks like it's just you, me, Patrick and Svend awake at the moment...
[12/3/2012 6:39:18 AM] Keera: haha! oh well
[12/3/2012 6:40:45 AM] Sara Farmer: I'm seeing hashtags #philippines #typhoon used together at the moment.
[12/3/2012 6:41:17 AM] Sara Farmer: Looks like Oxfam are gearing up too... Oxfam International ?@Oxfam

#Philippines: We're actively monitoring Typhoon Pablo (Bopha); with Humanitarian Response Consortium, our rapid assessment teams are ready
[12/3/2012 6:41:49 AM] Sara Farmer: Am also seeing #Bopha being used.
[12/3/2012 6:42:38 AM] Sara Farmer: Some background: here's a recent (4 hours old) report, with the expected typhoon track in it: http://ph.news.yahoo.com/evacuations-powerful-typhoon-nears-philippines-070032227.html
[12/3/2012 6:44:22 AM] Sara Farmer: This is interesting - a rename to "Pablo" could make searching quite interesting? PAGASA had said Typhoon Bopha is due to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility as early as 8 p.m. Once it does, it will be locally codenamed Pablo  http://ph.news.yahoo.com/possible-super-typhoon-moves-closer-par-may-landfall-095109245.html
[12/3/2012 6:46:58 AM] Jus Mackinnon: I am also here but in Vienna!
[12/3/2012 6:47:47 AM] Sara Farmer: Hi Jus! Get on with the meeting - if this thing hits like the floods did earlier this year, there'll be work to be done on this for a while...
[12/3/2012 6:48:05 AM] Sara Farmer: Meanwhile, from ?@CrisisMappers Crisis hashtags for Typhoon #PabloPh set up days *before* expected #Philippines landfall: Relief #reliefPH, Rescue #rescuePH ht @imogenwall
[12/3/2012 6:50:53 AM] Sara Farmer: Erm... @rapplerdotcom: Alarms now sounding off in Nazareth area, Cagayan de Oro City. #PabloPH (via @mindanaoan) http://rplr.co/YD5Ckv
[12/3/2012 6:53:56 AM] Sara Farmer: OKay. Scrub that, but this list of storm signal areas might be helpful: http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/12/03/12/storm-signal-no-3-over-12-areas
[12/3/2012 6:57:31 AM] Sara Farmer: Signal #3 is Winds of 101-185kph is expected in at least 18 hrs; signal #2 is Winds of 61-100 kph is expected within the next 24 hours; Signal #1 is Winds of 45-60kph is expected within the next 36 hours
[12/3/2012 6:58:05 AM] Sara Farmer: Might be worth finding Surigao Del Sur, Surigao Del Norte, Siargao, Dinagat, Agusan Del Norte, Agusan Del Sur and Davao Oriental on the map
[12/3/2012 7:02:12 AM] Sara Farmer: Hmm... all seem to be North and West of Davao.  Pablo might veer off, but definitely worth checking to see how good the maps are for that area.
[12/3/2012 7:03:30 AM] Sara Farmer: I have to go get ready for my trip now (am travelling today). Svend is in Vienna with Jus et al. Rest of East Coast US should be awake in the next couple of hours.
[12/3/2012 7:03:54 AM] Keera: hey Sara - i got access to the GDACS website - just checking whats GIS data.maps are there - if there's something good where's the best place to upload?
[12/3/2012 7:04:20 AM] Jus Mackinnon: The maps are good. Though being updated regularly
[12/3/2012 7:04:21 AM] Sara Farmer: Hi Keera!  Can set you up an area in the SBTF dropbox for now.
[12/3/2012 7:04:30 AM] Keera: for sure
[12/3/2012 7:04:34 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Hi Keera,
[12/3/2012 7:05:30 AM] Sara Farmer: Damn. Core team Dropbox got deleted (by Kirk, I think).  Will think of something else.
[12/3/2012 7:06:07 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Paste into a google doc and share link in window here?
[12/3/2012 7:06:29 AM] Jus Mackinnon: I have all the old  ones Keera if you want me to forward to you.
[12/3/2012 7:06:48 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Though I don't know if there is any value to keeping the old ones
[12/3/2012 7:08:05 AM] Keera: Jus - good idea -
[12/3/2012 7:08:14 AM] Sara Farmer: Okay. I'm setting up an area on my personal dropbox for now...
[12/3/2012 7:08:51 AM] Sara Farmer: Keera - email so I can add you to the dropbox please?
[12/3/2012 7:10:11 AM] Jus Mackinnon: fidget@jusmack.com is my account Sara for dropbox. Sorry you must have 7 emails for me!!
[12/3/2012 7:10:30 AM] Keera: keerapullman@gmail.com
[12/3/2012 7:12:53 AM] Keera: Jus/Sara - can you get to this link? not sure if you need a sig in or not http://tsunami.jrc.it/cyclonesurge/33913/final/locations.kml
[12/3/2012 7:16:48 AM] Sara Farmer: All... we have an internet problem here today. First rains since Sandy, and our outside connection keeps dying. I'll do what I can, but don't expect me to be online for a bit.
[12/3/2012 7:17:45 AM] Sara Farmer: Jus/Keera: you should be able to invite other people into the dropbox. Use it any way that seems sensible.
[12/3/2012 7:18:10 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Thank you Sara. Will do
[12/3/2012 7:19:49 AM] Keera: thanks Sara
[12/3/2012 7:20:01 AM] Sara Farmer: THanks both!
[12/3/2012 7:20:58 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Keera, We need a basic plan to start things off until we are told what is required.
[12/3/2012 7:21:33 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Shall we collate information and save in the dropbox?
[12/3/2012 7:21:51 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Then when everyone ready to roll there is at least a start
[12/3/2012 7:23:47 AM] Sara Farmer: Jus - absolutely!  It's likely to be hectic if it happens, so the more preparation up front, the better.
[12/3/2012 7:23:50 AM] Keera: sounds good
[12/3/2012 7:27:09 AM] Sara Farmer: Dropbox address is https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uil2sf4l9wftqm1/DEMuf177Gg - ask Keera or Jus if you need to be added to it.
[12/3/2012 7:31:08 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Keera, background doc I have uploaded of populations in region, infrastructure etc.
[12/3/2012 7:31:27 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Will add to that, Let me know what you think
[12/3/2012 7:32:25 AM] Keera: great!
[12/3/2012 7:33:59 AM] Jus Mackinnon: If we date and time every doc we save then we will know current version. (Sorry version control freak here)
[12/3/2012 7:35:52 AM] Sara Farmer: Good plan -=\
[12/3/2012 7:36:11 AM] Keera: Jus where is the doc?
[12/3/2012 7:36:11 AM] Sara Farmer: Sorry - Emily the cat just walked over the keyboard as I was typing.
[12/3/2012 7:36:28 AM] Jus Mackinnon: In dropbox. I made a new folder
[12/3/2012 7:37:10 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Keera you found it?
[12/3/2012 7:41:41 AM] Keera: Jus, i  can't see it?
[12/3/2012 7:42:18 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Hang on

[12/3/2012 7:43:47 AM] Virginia Brussa: http://www.pia.gov.ph/news/gis/index.php (layers by region)
[12/3/2012 7:43:59 AM] Virginia Brussa: ok, Jus
[12/3/2012 7:44:41 AM] Jus Mackinnon: I will upload an excel spreadsheet to use as a library of website giving information. Be good for people to add to it.
[12/3/2012 7:44:54 AM] Virginia Brussa: and FYI, another HT used ##typhoonbopha ( will add to doc)
[12/3/2012 7:45:28 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Keera and Virginia, Did you find the folder?
[12/3/2012 7:45:33 AM] Keera: great
Jus can you see the GIS data_maps folder?
[12/3/2012 7:45:45 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Yes. I will put the folder in there
[12/3/2012 7:45:49 AM] Keera: i still can't see the folder
[12/3/2012 7:45:54 AM] Keera: ok
[12/3/2012 7:46:18 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Try now please Keera
[12/3/2012 7:49:07 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Sorry Keera, Change of idea. Going to make the doc a google doc with open access so people can add to it and it is updated straight away
[12/3/2012 7:49:28 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Will still save information though in dropbox for docs completed
[12/3/2012 7:54:22 AM] Keera: OK - perfect

[12/3/2012 7:55:41 AM] Keera: yay!!!
[12/3/2012 7:59:58 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Happy with what I am doing?

[12/3/2012 8:01:18 AM] Keera: your faast!
[12/3/2012 8:01:19 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Great I will continue building.
[12/3/2012 8:05:38 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Keera if you look at bottom of the google doc That is what I would like to try and complete from the information above it.
[12/3/2012 8:07:12 AM] Keera: ok - i see
[12/3/2012 8:07:50 AM] Kirk Morris: Sara, thanks. I'm in touch with the principals of OccupySandy and Sahana. Listening.
[12/3/2012 8:09:36 AM] *** Keera added Jonas ***
[12/3/2012 8:09:44 AM] Virginia Brussa: done! shelters info into dropbox , can you see?
[12/3/2012 8:10:09 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Thank you Virginia I will go look
[12/3/2012 8:11:08 AM] Kirk Morris: Virginai... long time. I hope all is well.
[12/3/2012 8:11:38 AM] Virginia Brussa: hey Kirk! yes long time....all okay here and you?
[12/3/2012 8:12:22 AM] Kirk Morris: Ditto, very well here. Jazzed by the OccupySandy folks.

[12/3/2012 8:20:45 AM] Jonas: secondly, following sara's advice, I contacted celina agaton, based in the philippines and involved in crisis management. she could help with translation messages with her friends
[12/3/2012 8:20:46 AM] Jonas:  http://www.facebook.com/celinaagaton
[12/3/2012 8:20:52 AM] Jonas: keera, I gave her your email address
[12/3/2012 8:21:18 AM] Keera: awesome!
we started a drop-box for maps and GIS data - i'll send u invite
[12/3/2012 8:21:21 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Fantastic. I will keep working on doc.
[12/3/2012 8:21:22 AM] Jonas: hi justine! i just learned you are also in vienna? :)
[12/3/2012 8:21:43 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Yes, where are you? I am looking around!

[12/3/2012 8:22:48 AM] Jonas: let's connect in the break
[12/3/2012 8:22:50 AM] Jonas: :)
[12/3/2012 8:23:00 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Yes definately
[12/3/2012 8:23:52 AM] Jonas: here, storm info
[12/3/2012 8:23:53 AM] Jonas: http://www.hewsweb.org/storms/#
[12/3/2012 10:14:43 AM] Kirk Morris: Yes, Sara I deleted the Drop Box (I was paying for it). Informed you and that I had saved all data. You replied you'd take care of it and extablish a new dropbox.
[12/3/2012 10:15:21 AM] Per Aarvik (KHiB): Hi all! Amazing reaction speed. Count me in whenever tasks are to be done?
[12/3/2012 11:12:02 AM] Jus Mackinnon: Thank you. We will yell don't worry!!!!
[12/3/2012 1:12:17 PM] Sara Farmer: Kirk - thanks... a *lot* has happened in my world since that conversation. Will work out how to set up new dropbox account for SBTF and port the data you saved into there... once I'm in one place for more than 30 minutes... probably tonight...
[12/3/2012 1:21:02 PM] Sara Farmer: Okay... SBTF dropbox created - core team: see my email for username and pword to get into it.
[12/3/2012 1:23:42 PM] Sara Farmer: Jus, Keera: have given you a folder in there too (see your emails).   I have no probs with you continuing to use my personal dropbox for the rest of this deployment, but the SBTF folder is there too if you need / want to use it.  I'll be impressed if you manage to get 200M that quickly though...
[12/3/2012 2:01:51 PM] Jus Mackinnon: If you get stuck I have 115GB on dropbox lol

[12/9/2012 1:03:14 PM] Leesa Astredo: FYI     In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, this Forum event will explore how people and cities rebound from devastating natural disasters and how they prepare for new catastrophes. With millions of people living in coastal cities, coupled with changing weather patterns, natural disasters present significant public health and policy implications  -- from managing crises, to safeguarding infrastructure, to bolstering and leveraging the resilience of people and cities. This Forum event will be presented in collaboration with The Huffington Post.  (LINK TO EVENT>>> http://theforum.sph.harvard.edu/events/big-weather-and-coastal-cities )

[12/12/2012 10:15:52 PM] Melissa Elliott: Ashley, Brenna, Cody & Ronald - the SBTF is not currently deployed on any activities. If you haven't taken a look at the training material (links in the email from Kirk), now would be a fantastic time to familiarize yourselves with our process and workflows.
[12/12/2012 10:16:48 PM] Melissa Elliott: Each deployment has specific needs, but in general, our process of activation and communication via skype is consistent.  If you have any questions at all, this window is the best place to ask.
