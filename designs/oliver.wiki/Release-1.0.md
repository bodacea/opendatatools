This page defines the scope for the first release. At the moment we
are trying to define that scope so we are using this page to collect
thoughts and ideas that would deliver a valuable minimum product

## Constraints
1. One week of development effort

## Idea 1
* Be able to register a world bank data source, gather meta data about
  that datasource from the API and provide simple visualisations
  (timeline and geospacial) that help document the API and what can be
  done with the data.

## Idea 2
 * As Idea 1 but using the new UN Data API and gem
