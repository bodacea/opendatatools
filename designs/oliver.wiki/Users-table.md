Every Oliver platform has users (even if it's only the guy maintaining the platform).

## Table features

* uid
* home site (because the platform may have remote users on other sites)
* profile description
* password (hashed)
* name
* affiliation (we may want to manage some data access by affiliation)
* nickname
* icon
* verified (because we need to know the difference between users adding their own accounts and affiliations, and admin-checked credentials).

## Cool things about users

* Users can find people like themselves. We have all these cool search tools, why don't we let users use them for themselves?
