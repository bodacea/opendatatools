What we're asking the system to do:

* [[Design background]] - the original user requirement for this project
* [[System environments]] - the contexts that the system is designed for
* [[User stories]] - what the users want the system to do
* [[Requirements]] - the 'rules' that stakeholders (including us) put on the system

How it's expected to connect: 

* [[System interfaces]] - how the system talks to things outside it
* [[System APIs]] - connectors that other systems can use
* [[Use cases]] - how the components and environment interact to do stuff

What's expected inside the box:

* [[System tables]] - database tables
* [[User interfaces]] - how the system looks to its users
