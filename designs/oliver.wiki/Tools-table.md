Oliver platforms hold links to potentially useful tools; they can also hold tools, where needed for resilience or because they're analysts' working instances of these tools.  The tool storage mechanisms haven't been worked out yet - this table is for managing the links to tools.

## Table features

* uid
* name
* original source information
  * generating agency
  * language (python, ruby, php etc)
  * date of acquisition from tool provider
* contributor info
  * contributor uid
* access priviledges
  * tool affiliation (we may want to manage some tool access by affiliation)
  * who is allowed to view
  * who is allowed to edit
  * who is allowed to change/ revoke access priviledges
* data standards used
* link to metadata in (if it exists)
* link to metadata out (if it exists)
* api address (if it exists)

## Cool things about tools

Nothing yet, but I'm sure we'll find something.

## Possible extensions

* Tools need to be tagged, to allow users to search for tools relevant to their task. It's possible to build ontologies of these tags (and linking information).
