## Non-functional requirements:

* Privacy by design

  * Include security measures to prevent users from accessing data, applications, notes etc that are not public to them.  
  * Security measures should be especially mindful of the system's handling of private and commercially sensitive data.

* Difficult communications environments

  * Function in low-bandwidth environments
  * function in intermittent bandwidth environments. 
  * Platform should continue to function when all external Internet links are cut.
  * A low-bandwidth interface could be developed for difficult comms environments.

* Usability

  * Someone with minimal technical skills should be able to system manage a platform.
  * Easy adaptation for non-English language users. 
  * Undecided yet whether to restrict available character sets to unicode.

* Scalability. 

  * Initial system expected to contain 6 platforms rising to approx 100 platforms (including platforms at data and processing sites) but external uptake might raise this estimate by an order of magnitude. 

##Development constraints:

* A pilot system must be built by the end of 2011.
