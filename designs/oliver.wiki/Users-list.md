This user interface displays a list of entries for the [[Users table]].  Entities in it are: 

* User name: the full name (firstname surname) of this user
* Home site: the name of the user's home platform
* Affiliation: the primary group that this user is affiliated with
* Find user: button to allow user to search for other users by name, affiliation etc.

The users gui design and table design have been reconciled with each other.
