This user interface displays data for one entry of the [[Datastores table]].  Entities in it are: 

* Name: the name given to this datastore
* Description: free-text description of the datastore
* Dates: histogram of dates in this datastore
* Map: Map of geographical coverage of this datastore
* Tags: user-given tags for this datastore
* Quality scores: free-text description of user quality
* Comments: a set of user comments about this datastore

The datastore gui design and table design need to be reconciled with each other.
