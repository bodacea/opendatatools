This user interface displays data for one entry of the [[Users table]].  Entities in it are: 

* Name: the user's name
* Icon: picture of the user
* Profile text: user-input free-text description of themself
* Home site: platform this user is attached to
* Affiliation: group this user belongs to (need to think about this)
* Nickname: user-given nickname
* Email: user's email address
* Password: user's platform password
* Confirm: password confirmation (if changed)
* Verified: user has been verified as kosher

The user gui design and table design have been reconciled with each other.
