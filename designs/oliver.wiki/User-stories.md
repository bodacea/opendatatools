## User stories and user tasks

For each type of user, we're going to list a set of user stories (things that the user wants to do with the system), and break these down into user tasks (the specific things that the user needs to do to make that happen).  The user stories below should fit this template: "as a role, I want to do something because reason" with a short (no more than can fit onto an index card) explanation of how I expect to do this.  Once we've collected enough stories, we'll arrange them by priority with the users (or proxy users), and use that as the first build list. 

### As an analyst, I want... 

* I want to test a hypothesis that I have about something that I think may be happening in my area of interest, so I can alert policymakers earlier about upcoming crises. I look to see if there's a similar hypothesis in the system, and if there isn't, I create a page for the hypothesis, add a note about it and look for relevant indicators in the datasets available to me. I might also share this hypothesis with other analysts that might have an interest in it, or be able to help me gather evidence and prove or disprove it.

* I want to see if anyone else has a hypothesis that might interest me, so I can get early alert about a crisis in my area.  I look at the hypotheses from users in my groups and users with similar interests to me. If I find an interesting hypothesis, I open it up to see what evidence and notes have been gathered so far. I might put a 'watch' on it, add my name to a group formed around it, or add my own notes and evidence to it.

* I want to know which indicator ontologies are available for my areas of interest, so I can add them to my crisis alert set. If I find an interesting ontology, I want to view it, with example results from using it on example datasets or feeds. If it looks useful to me, I want to mark it as useful.

* I want to know if indicator ontologies of interest to me have been updated recently, so I can rerun analyses that use them.

* I want to know which datasets are available for my areas of interest.  If there aren't many of these, I'd like to see a list - if there are lots of them, I'd like to be able to search through them. If I look at dataset details, I'd like to see example data if that's possible.

* I want machine access to as many datasets as possible, so I can use them directly with my toolset without having to build data converters. 

* I want to set 'watches' for specific indicators in my data feeds, and to be alerted if these indicators appear in areas or numbers that are of interest to me. 

Tasks: 

* to list all the datasets that are available to me
* to search dataset metadata for data that might be interesting to me
* to query data that's held on this platform
* to query data that's held on other platforms in my network
* to query data that's held outside my network
* to look at recent data in a real-time data feed
* to manage a list of datasets of interest to me
* to manage my working notes on specific problems
* to share my working notes with other users

### As a platform manager, I want...

* I want to manage the list all datasets that are available from this platform. 

* I want to manage the set of internal datasets that are directly connected to this platform. I want to hide some internal datasets from users who are not part of this platform. I want to advertise and share some internal datasets with other platforms and systems.

* I want to manage the set of external datasets that are directly connected to this platform. I may need to keep a set of up-to-date datasets for crisis planners if we lose internet connection. I may also want to keep regularly-used datasets locally, to reduce down our bandwidth requirements.

### As a dataset owner, I want...

* to restrict who can see, use and modify my dataset

### As a tool owner, I want...

* to upload new versions of my tool to the network

### As a network manager, I want...

* to list all the platforms in my network
