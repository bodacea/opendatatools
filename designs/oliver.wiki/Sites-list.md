This user interface displays a list of entries for the [[Sites table]].  Entities in it are: 

* Site news: recent changes to listed sites
* Site name: name of each site
* Purpose: primary use of each site (data, tools, general etc)
* Affiliation: primary group affiliation of each site
* Bandwidth: bandwidth restrictions on each site (low bandwidth, intermittent, full bandwidth etc)

The sites gui design and table design have been reconciled with each other.
