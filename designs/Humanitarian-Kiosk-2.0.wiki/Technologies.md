We're looking for file-sharing technologies that allow users to download files from the information kiosk at a distance, and keep those files updated when they get internet (or wifi or whatever we're using to connect in the field) connections. We want people to get the latest meeting schedule etc. as soon as they can. We also know that sometimes the Internet won't be working, and people still need to share files when that happens. 

### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

Internet-based application that stores files on your offline machine, then updates it when you connect to the internet.

### [Bump](http://bu.mp/)

Bump is a smartphone (iphone, android) app that allows users to share data from phone to phone. Bump only works if there's a solid internet connection to each phone.
