Welcome to the Humanitarian-Kiosk-2.0 wiki!

This system was requested by Andrej Verity from UNOCHA Geneva. People involved in this project include Willow Brugh and Sara Farmer.

### The Humanitarian Kiosk

Imagine if senior managers, operation staff, etc could simply reference their phone, ipad or computer and know that they always have the latest situation report, latest emergency numbers, latest maps, etc on their device.  Imagine meetings where people could be talking about the very, very latest numbers because it is simply available in their pocket!  If we built it in a open-source manner, other entities could use it for multiple purposes: pushing information to the affected populations [via connected entities like radio stations], pushing content to all their field staff, etc, etc. inside the emergency arena. The old kiosk concept is still very valid, but we can use modern technologies to turn the same concept into a revolutionary tool for the humanitarian response.  Essentially, we are going to put the operational information onto responders’ computers, iPads and/or smartphones, keep it up-to-date with almost no effort, and enable responders to easily share this library with others. The best part is that the technologies to do so are essentially available.  

### What is the current Humanitarian Kiosk?

The [information kiosk](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22information%20kiosk%22%20unocha) is simply a terminal-like computer where the humanitarian community can come with their flash drive and copy all the latest files / data and return to their office. With serious bandwidth constraints for many smaller organizations, it can be a life-line to the latest information - especially when talking about large files such as the latest maps. The kiosk is placed in a reception centre (e.g. Haiti) or at the central meeting location (e.g. Pakistan). The kiosk is maintained by an information management staff member who physically updates the files on the computer on a regular basis.  

Typically the kiosk contains files like latest situation report, contact list, meeting schedule, maps, summary numbers, etc. Generally they are PDF files so nothing sophisticated is needed at the moment. 

### So, What is HK2?  

HK2 makes use of tools such as [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Bump](http://bu.mp/) to push files out from one central location to anyone who wishes to subscribe and makes it painfully simple for any existing user to effortlessly “bump” the library to a nearby mobile device. Imagine if an organization could update one folder and those contents are replicated through the cloud to all subscribers - these clients would always have the latest products and data on their devices. Imagine sitting in meeting in the operation and having the latest information at your fingertips even if not connected to the Internet. And, imagine if the person next to you did not, but you could simply “bump” your devices and s/he would have it to. This approach would not only will help the in-disaster responders, but virtual teams, senior management, and even media outside the arena could easily subscribe and have the latest information at all times. This approach would not make the old kiosk redundant. To the contrary; it would make the physical kiosk much easier to manage as it would simply become a subscriber thereby relieving most maintenance work. And Internet bandwidth challenges will remain in some major emergencies like the Haiti earthquake. However, we can now have both. The HK2 would very much complement any response website. The HK2 would be a place for the latest documents and would not hold an archive. A response website would hold a trove of other information and applications, would hold the latest information, and would maintain an archive of all files. It would be the place for visitors to start and would be the place where visitors could subscribe to the HK2. 

[A diagram of the expected information/data flow and the clients needed for this solution](https://docs.google.com/a/unglobalpulse.org/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=1fpch1a7nYicehyjwCz3yaYASMKgOjxTg7cmE2NZN-QM&hl=en_US). This solution makes use of Dropbox as the back-end, their 'shareable' private folders, and simple scripts to generate the necessary RSS/XML feeds. The diagram outlines the various clients and platforms that would be needed for such a solution. It outlines the access each client would or would not have to the dropbox folders and basically how the information could be displayed on each device. The second page of the document explains the various numbers [on the first slide] and assigns priorities.   

### Next Steps

The challenge now is to actually implement this approach. The sharing technology is not hard, but will require some investigation to select the right solution. This component could likely be implemented in the matter of a few weeks (pending any procurement challenges). The Bump technology exists, but is focused on music so would have to be modified (perhaps in partnership with Bu.mp themselves) and thus would need to be implemented in the second phase. With the right support and resources, the first version of the HK2 could be alive and working within a few months. And, for a simple solution that could drastically change how emergency response is carried out, I believe the HK2 should be immediately prioritized. It is simple and exciting. We need to act now. It would be the place for visitors to start and would be the place where visitors could subscribe to the HK2.  

### Qualitative Impact: 

We have established that this approach would be putting the latest files and information directly on your machine and you can share it easily. But what other benefits will it provide? Here are a few: 

1. Senior management of humanitarian organizations would have the latest information at their fingertips; 
2. Donors would the latest information at their fingertips (and could not plead ignorance); 
3. Organizations could integrate the HK2 into their Intranets for display to all staff; 
4. Multiple HK2s could be created for each emergency. Examples such as Latest Information, Maps, Cluster-specific, and Working Groups quickly come to mind; 
5. Public and private versions would be possible; 
6. Remote support could be better enabled; 
7. The local community could choose to subscribe if they have the bandwidth and appropriate devices; and 
8. Devise appropriate base maps could be included in the library to enable users to perform Humanitarian Scratch Mapping on perfect backgrounds.
