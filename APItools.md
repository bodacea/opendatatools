This is a brief resource showing some data tools that we have access to.

API Connect

DataPower

MicroGateway

These are free to use and I can arrange support and guidance once we come up with a solid use case.
I think an excellent service would be to provide API access to various organizations that didn't consider this means of communication. 
API Connect makes API management and utilization dirt-simple.
DataPower allows us to create transforms for organizations that have API in alternate formats.
OpenCrisis could provide the logic that connects many actors' data, for the benefit of all.
MicroGateway watches for patterns and enacts a user-defined policy.
